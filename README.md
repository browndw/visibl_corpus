## VISiBL Corpus
This repository contains the **Voicing Imperial Subjects in British Literature** (VISiBL) corpus.

The corpus was compiled for *[English and Empire](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/english-and-empire/26FCC2B9999687D7D10643CEE7BA7421)*, which analyzes novels, short stories, and plays written by British authors and published between 1768 and 1929: 

> Combining statistical modeling and archival study, *English and Empire* investigates how African diasporic, Chinese, and Indian characters have been voiced in British fiction and drama produced between 1768 and 1929.  The analysis connects patterns of linguistic representation to changes in the imperial political economy, to evolving language ideologies that circulate in the Anglophone world, and to shifts in sociocultural anxieties that crosscut race and empire. In carrying out its investigation, the book also makes the case for a methodological approach that links the distant (quantitative) and close (qualitative) reading of diverse digital artifacts.

The book's primary object of study is what is commonly called "[literary dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_dialect)". Thus, there are examples of literary dialect in all of the corpus texts, like the following from Sax Rohmer's *[The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystery_of_Dr._Fu-Manchu)*:
> "Allee lightee," he said. "Full up -- no loom. You come see."

In this excerpt, the dialogue of a Chinese barber is rendered using grammatical structures and respellings (like substituting *l* for *r* so *room* is represented as *loom*). These renderings, the book argues, are **not** neutral efforts to mimic **"just the way people talk"**, but are tied to the political, social, and cultural conditions of Britain and the British Empire at the time. In this case, Rohmer's novel is published during a period of [anti-Chinese paranoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Peril) and his voicing of the barber is consistent with stereotypes reinforcing and amplifying that paranoia.

## A Word of Caution
The corpus contains racist language and demeaning depictions of African diasporic, Chinese, and Indian characters, communities, and vocal cultures.
