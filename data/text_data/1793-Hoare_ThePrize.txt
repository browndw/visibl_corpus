ACT I.

SCENE I.

-- A Room at an Inn.

Heartwell discovered asleep in an undress on a sofa, R. , Juba sitting by him playing on a guitar, L. -- after the air, Heartwell awakes.

Hea.
Juba!

Juba.
You call, massa?

Hea.
How long have I been asleep?

Juba.
You sleep long time, massa; most two hour; sleep do you good; you better now, massa; Juba glad you better.

Hea.
How unfortunate was this accident, during my search after Caroline! whilst I was every hour in hopes of tracing out the place to which her father has conveyed her, to be laid up for six days at an inn; without money, without friends, without -- 

Juba.
Don't you sorry, massa; I your friend -- 

Hea.
Poor little fellow! I have no power at present to reward thee.

Juba.
You good to me, massa, when I come from my own country; you very good when I sick; no mind you no money; you have money bine by.

SONG -- Juba .

You care of money, care no more,
No tink if you be rich or poor,
My mind employ;
Me stay with you; no sorry, no!
And where away my massa go,
Go poor black boy.

You good to me, dat keepy here;
No, massa! dat you never fear;
Long time destroy;
You know death kill, but leave one part
He never kill de loving heart
Of poor black boy!

Hea.
This kind creature's gratitude for the freedom I procured for him is without bounds.
[Juba bowing, L. ]
Who are you bowing to there?

Juba.
Massa Lenitive, you doctor, he come here.

Hea.
I'm not more tired of my sick room than I am of my apothecary: in a country town one is glad of any assistance that can be met with; but never, sure, was there such a mixture of ignorance and professional importance, as in this fellow.

Juba.
He come to door, on stair, now, massa

Hea.
Now, then, for my ears to be dinn'd with a battery of technical terms. I'll dismiss him to-day, I'm determined.

Enter Lenitive , L. D. -- Juba goes round to R. , and stands back.

Len.
Mr. Heartwell, your obedient! you slept well, doubtless, on the balsamic?

Hea.
Thanks to your care and skill, Mr. Lenitive, I am now quite well.

Len.
By no means, sir! Yesterday your pulse intimated an approximation to convalescence; but you are yet much disordered. Did you take those little medicines that I ordered you this morning?

Hea.
Yes; and want nothing now but fresh air to strengthen me.

Len.
Give me leave, sir -- 
[Sits down by him on the sofa, L. , pulls out his watch, and feels Heartwell's pulse.]
You must keep yourself remarkably quiet, and not suffer any one to speak to you: in all cases, Mr. Heartwell, of a similar nature to your's, where either laceration or extravasation takes place on the membraneous or cartilaginous fibres, the -- you'll excuse me, sir -- I'm afraid I don't make myself perfectly understood?

Hea. [Aside.]
Indeed, you do not.
[Aloud.]
Oh, perfectly, sir! Go on.

Len.
I just remarked, sir, that where a systole or diastole is caused by any affection of the intercostal muscles, or the diaphragm in those cases -- 

Enter Label , L. D.

Lab. [To Lenitive.]
A letter for you, sir.

Len. [Rises.]
Bless my soul! you'll excuse me, Mr. Heartwell -- some cause of importance -- I'm so overcharged with patients -- great rapidity of ideas, captain, requisite for a medicinal person -- one moment weighing the vibration of the nerves, and another diving into the viscera.

Hea.
A mistake might, I presume, be dangerous?

Len. [Sits.]
Fatal, sir -- absolutely fatal! An accident of the kind happened here last week -- Doctor Lancet, my opponent -- for merit, sir -- you know, sir, merit every where has its shadow -- Doctor Lancet, sir, ordered a medicine, styptic, congestive, and anticathartic, which he intended to go directly to the lungs; but, unfortunately, not recollecting that his patient's complaint lay in the plexus hepaticus, and not in the pulmonaria -- medicine, to be sure, did its business.

Hea.
And the patient's business, too, I suppose.

Len.
Exactly so, sir -- 
[Laughing.]
ha, ha, ha!

     [Rises.

Lab.
Ha, ha, ha!

     [Laughing heartily, till checked by Lenitive.

Len.
You'll excuse my young man -- ha! ha! fond of a joke -- oh, Label!
[Sits.]
It was exactly so, sir -- I am cautious in saying it -- but you'll excuse me whilst I read this -- the case, perhaps, is pressing -- odso! an express from London! a consultation, probably -- nothing more usual -- eh, Label! you know nothing more common?

Lab. (L.)
Oh, no, nothing -- nothing more common with us.

Len. [Reads.]
" Sir -- Your ticket " -- so, so! an account of one of my lottery tickets -- 
[Rises.]
" Sir -- Your ticket in the English lottery, No. 78, was on the 10th day drawn -- a blank! " -- Um! always dabbling in the lottery! never shall have any luck! -- " And your ticket, No. 2 , 5, 3, 8, was this day drawn a prize of Â£10,000, principal money ." -- Bless my -- 

Hea.
But pray, doctor -- 

Len.
Ten thousand pounds!

     [Jumps about in ecstasy.

Hea.
But pray, now, Mr. Lenitive -- 

Len.
No. 2, 5, 3, 8! a lucky number, indeed!
[Aside.]
I know what I'll do with it -- but I'll keep it a secret.

Hea.
Why, what possesses the man! but I say, Doctor Lenitive -- 

     [Rises, and follows him about, L. to R.

Len. ( L. C. ) [Resuming his gravity.]
Oh! I had forgot my patient!

Lab.
Any orders for the shop, sir?

Len.
Damn the shop! -- Eh! what? -- No, no, I shall return presently.

Lab.
Damn the shop! -- Why, I never heard such -- 

     [Exit, muttering, L. D.

Len.
You'll excuse me, sir, but a case that was particularly interesting -- 

Hea.
A successful one, I presume, by the violent symptoms of your joy?

Len.
Yes, sir, very successful indeed: more than I could expect.

Hea. [Aside.]
That's the first modest word I ever heard him speak of himself.

     [Sits.

Len.
2, 5, 3, 8! But I forget my patient -- I think you were saying, sir -- 

Hea.
I was saying, sir, that I find myself so much recovered as to have no longer need to trouble you.

Len. [Sits.]

Give me leave -- give me leave, sir -- 
[Feels his pulse.]
Why, ay, sir, your ticket -- pho! your fever, I mean, sir -- yes, fever, as you say, is quite subsided -- yes -- bless me, how lucky! Ten thousand pounds! quite subsided -- yes, I say, quite. However, I would advise you to continue on your couch another day, sir -- ten thousand! how I shall astonish Mr. Caddy with the news! I and my dear Miss Caroline, too -- but -- zounds! I forgot my patient! I could wish you, sir -- let me consider -- I can't think how I shall get the money sent down to me -- I could wish you not to go out to-day, sir.

Hea.
Well, sir, as you please, for one day more -- but must I continue my draughts!

Len.
Drafts! egad! well thought on! I'd better have it sent down in drafts. Draughts! yes, sir -- no, no -- I -- I shall send you some drops to take.

Hea.
But what number?

Len. [Jumps up.]
Number two thousand five hundred and thirty-eight -- a most lucky number!

Hea. [Rises.]
Two thousand drops! Why, zounds! I should be all day in counting 'em!

Len.
Count -- no, no, sir -- I mean -- no, nine or ten drops -- nine or ten will be quite sufficient -- I forget my patient, indeed.

Hea.
Why, sure the man's crazy.

Len.
You'll excuse me, captain, but I am engaged to attend Mr. Caddy, and shall see you again in the afternoon.

     [Going, L.

Hea. [Eagerly.]
Mr. Caddy, sir? -- Is he in the neighbourhood?

Len.
He has a house near here, sir, of which he has

lately taken possession; famous for one of the finest collections of Chinese curiosities in Europe; which I am myself going to enrich to-day with -- ten thousand pounds! I mean -- a celebrated mummy of a Chinese bonze, or high priest -- I'll give you a particular account of it -- a -- 

Hea.
Another time, if you please. Pray, Mr. Lenitive, has Mr. Caddy a daughter?

Len.
Two thousand five hundred and thirty-eight.

Hea.
How! what?

Len.
Odso! ask pardon, sir -- daughter! yes, sir, Miss Caroline, a most accomplished and amiable young lady. Well, you'll continue in your room to-day.

Hea. [In raptures.]
You'll excuse me, sir -- Juba, my things to dress.

     [Exit Juba, R.

Len.
Bless me! his fever's returned -- my dear sir, you must not think of stirring out to-day for -- ten thousand pounds!

Hea.
But I must -- I hope my journey will produce double the sum -- how fortunate!

Len.
Fortunate, indeed, sir -- astonishingly fortunate: but, dear sir, you are not aware that, by exposing yourself thus suddenly to the inclemency of the atmosphere -- 

Hea.
Pray leave me now, sir.

Len.
You'll close the reticula of the cutis.

Hea.
Begone, I say!

Len.
Begone! oh, yes -- he's quite delirious -- but consider, sir, the coagulation of the juices.

Hea.
Zounds! depart, I say.

     [Driving him off, L. D.

Len.
For a strait waistcoat -- take care, sir, how you bring on a constipation of the fluids.

Hea.
Death and fire! get out.

     [Pushes him.

Len.
And at the termination of the complaint, produce a mortification of the nobler intestines, which will finally complete the dissolution of the system.

Hea.
Ten thousand devils fly away with you.

Len.
Ten thousand pounds, 2, 5, 3, 8!

     [Exit, L. D.

Hea.
This fellow's certainly mad -- there's no end to his impertinence.
[Calling.]
Juba -- 
Enter Juba .

Bring me pen, ink, and paper directly, and go again to the post-office.
[Exit Juba.]
Now for my Caroline -- the hope of seeing her revives me to life, health, and spirits. This blockhead, Lenitive, has done me some good at last.

     [Exit, R.

SCENE II.

-- The Outside of a Villa, L. U. E.

Caroline discovered at the window, throwing up the sash.

AIR -- Caroline.

Ah, tell me, softly-breathing gale,
Did you my voice obey?
Ah, did you tell the plaintive tale?
The tender sigh convey?
Ah, faithless gales! ye were unkind,
Ye did no sighs convey.
Enter Juba , R.

DUET -- Caroline and Juba .

Juba.
What singy? hark! so much me please,
How music set my heart at ease!

Car.
Ah, Juba!

Juba.
Is it you? or only fancy no tell true.

Car.
Go, haste to let thy master know
The transport of my mind?

Juba.
That voice me sure have in my mind, -- 
Who singy there, I pray?

Car.
Ah, may I hope, if he return,
A constant heart to find.

Juba.
Me haste to let me massa know
The transport of your mind, &c. &c.

Juba.
Ah, missy! me glad to see you; my massa be very glad.

Car.
Is Mr. Heartwell in this town? -- Where is he? How does he do?

Juba.
Iss, Missy: massa here at inn close by; he send me to post great many time -- me bring you no letter -- massa be sad, but he not -- 

Mrs. Caddy. [Calling, without, L. U. E. ]
Caroline!

Car.
Ma'am -- what, is he not -- Juba?

Mrs. C. [Calling.]
Caroline, where are you all this while?

Car.
Coming this instant, ma'am -- but, Juba, tell me of Heartwell -- isn't he well?

Jub.
He no well now, missy; but he well when he see you.

Mrs. C. [Calling.]
Caroline, come down directly, and shut the window.

Car.
Coming, mamma -- Juba, haste to your master, tell him my father has selected an odious apothecary to be my husband; but that I'm determined I won't have him.

Mrs. C. [Calling.]
Why, Caroline, I say -- 

Car.
Coming, mamma.

Juba.
Very well, missy, me tell him: dis do my massa heart good; dis better dan eat and drink, and 'pothecary's stuff, too: me tell my massa dis now, go to post by and by.

     [Exit, R. -- Caroline shuts the window.

SCENE III.

-- An Apothecary's Shop -- physic, vials, &c.

Enter Lenitive , L.

Len.
Ten thousand pounds! wherefore should I be an apothecary? -- Pho! throw physic to the dogs! I'll be a gentleman! If I marry Miss Caroline, with the addition of her fortune, I shall make one of the finest figures in the universe. I was born to gentility!
[Struts.]
I feel it in my veins, in my bones, and the whole mass of my circulation -- but the opening of my fortune, ay, that's the point -- it would be a nice hint if I could devise some recipe to surprise Mr. Caddy's family smartly at the time of discovery -- a few grains of the bel esprit, on this occasion, may operate in my favour.

Enter Label , L. -- he attempts to speak several times to Lenitive, and at last pulls him by the sleeve.

Lab.
Sir, sir!

Len.
Ha, Label!

Lab.
You've been very much wanted here, sir; Lady Blubber and Mrs. Restless have sent to desire you'd come directly to 'em -- I have been up at Mrs. Neverwell's -- I'm afraid that will turn out a bad job -- she has taken every prescription in our day-book, and I don't know what more can be done for the poor creature -- she was piteous bad, and crying out with pain.

     [Lenitive appears absorbed and unmindful of Label's speaking -- and at last bursts out into a loud laugh.

Lab.
How! what! does it divert you, sir?

Len.
That will do! I have got an excellent thought just come into my head.

Lab.
I'm glad of it, for they are all desperate sad.

Len.
Yes, I have it.

Lab.
Dear me I'm glad of it. D'ye think you can cure her, sir?

Len.
How it will surprise 'em.

Lab.
Yes, that will surprise 'em, indeed; and I'm sure it will yield great joy to the whole family.

Len.
Eh! why, yes, as you say, Label, they'll all enjoy it mightily. I'll tell you how I'll manage it.

Lab.
Well, sir.

Len.
You know I have promised to give Mr. Caddy an old Chinese figure, which I have told him is a high priest embalmed -- now, as this is a curious case -- 

Lab.
Quite puzzling, sir.

Len.
I'll send him two instead of one -- so do you go to the carpenter's.

Lab.
The carpenter's!

Len.
Yes, to be sure, the carpenter's.

Lab.
But, dear sir, the poor lady's situation won't admit of delay; for I warrant you she's in fits again by this time.

Len.
Fits! who's in fits?

Lab.
Mrs. Neverwell, sir.

Len.
Mrs. Neverwell, blockhead! Answer me, Label, don't you know I've got the ten-thousand pound prize?

Lab.
How, sir? ten thousand pound!

Len.
Ay, 2, 5, 3, 8; and now I tell you -- if ever you speak a word to me about fits or physic again, I'll poison ye, ye dog.

Lab.
Poison me!

Len.
Yes, I'll poison you.

Lab.
No, I fancy you won't venture that.

Len.
Not venture; pray, why not?

Lab.
Because you'll be afraid I shall repay you in kind.

Len.
Why! do you pretend to enter the lists with me in my profession? -- In the Arte Necandi.

Lab.
And why not, pray? -- I believe I can lay claim to as many pretty little accidents as yourself.

Len.
Indeed! how so, pray?

Lab.
Yes, indeed; and you reaped the benefit of 'em. Who d'ye think made all the mayor's family sick, when you got so many fees from 'em, one after another?

Len.
Why, who?

Lab.
Who but I? -- Monsieur Fricandeau, the French cook, was my old acquaintance; so, under pretence of recommending him some very nice sauce for the mayor,

that I bought him, I whipp'd in a little saccharum saturni, and gave the whole family the cholic. If you recollect, by making a slight increase of their disorder at the beginning, you kept 'em under your care for nine weeks.

Len.
Why, yes, that was a snug job, I must own.

Lab.
Therefore, sir, if you're retiring from business, I should be glad if you'd please to recommend me.

Len.
Label, you shall succeed me -- Eris Secundus Apollo -- you shall be the second Apollo.

Lab.
Thank ye, sir.

Len.
I herewith invest you with the insignia of wisdom; take my cane, take my hat, take my wig, take my coat, waistcoat -- 

Lab.
But have you not promised to go to Mr. Caddy's this morning, sir? -- You won't go without your wig, will you?

Len.
That's true, Label; I must go once more as an apothecary -- pho! but never more will I look on a gallipot -- you shall never more know me to have been an apothecary.

Lab.
Not know you! lord bless you! why, I should know you all the world over for an apothecary, by your talk.

Len.
But you shall now see the difference; you shall never hear from my mouth a single word that shall remind you of physic; for certainly nothing is so vulgar as for a man's conversation to smell of his shop.

Lab.
Lord, sir, you've begun already:
[Laughing.]
ha, ha! why, that's secundem artem -- "Smell of your shop!"

Len.
Why, did I say so?

Lab.
Oh, yes, you did.

Len.
Did I! smell of my shop! Well, it was the last motion of my physic within my lips; now, be sure you don't let a tittle of my ten thousand pass through you to any living -- I'll surprise 'em with the sudden eclat -- break out on the whole family -- so, d'ye hear, Label, if any patients send to me for medicines or advice, tell 'em to take notice -- take -- no, plague on't, that take is an apothecary's word -- smells of the shop, too -- tell 'em to take -- 

Lab.
At it again, sir; take -- 

Len.
Damnation! tell 'em to take themselves about their business.

Enter Boy , with a basket, L.

Boy.

Some bottles, sir, for your shop.

Len.
Damn bottles and the shop!

     [Kicks them out of the Boy's hand.

Lab.
There, now, see what a number of bottles -- 

Len.
Damn all numbers but 2, 5, 3, 8! Throw physic to the dogs -- 2, 5, 3, 8! ten thousand pounds!

     [Exit, kicking off basket, and breaking the bottles on the shelf as he goes off, R. -- Label and Boy run off, L.

SCENE IV.

-- A Parlour at Caddy's.

Enter Caddy , with a letter, followed by Mrs. Caddy , R.

Cad.
Here, here's a fellow throws himself on my generosity.

Mrs. C.
Why, surely nothing can be handsomer than Mr. Heartwell's behaviour in writing thus to you.

Cad.
And what do you think he does it for? -- Because he does not want my girl without her fortune.

Mrs. C.
And no one is more deserving of her fortune, and her too.

Cad.
But he sha'nt have it, though -- no, no, trade got it, and let trade keep it; I'll have my daughter happy in my own way -- Mr. Lenitive is a proper orderly young man, in a good business; a man of science and good taste. Do you know that he has promised to send me a true old Chinese bonze to-day?

Mrs. C.
Old bonze! hav'nt you old bones enough of your own already?

Cad.
Pho! pho! but where's Caroline all this time? Caroline -- 

Enter Caroline , R.

Car.
Did you want me, papa?

Cad.
To be sure, I do. Look here, hussy, -- you know Mr. Heartwell's hand, I suppose?

     [Shows the letter.

Car.
Oh dear, yes, that I do.

Cad.
Didn't I charge you, before you left town, when I retired to this seat, which I came to entirely on your account; didn't I, I say, charge you to break off all acquaintance with Mr. Heartwell, because he had not money enough to support you.

Car.
Yes, papa; and you charged me, before we left

town, to love Mr. Heartwell; and, as you changed your mind once, I hoped you might do the same again.

Cad.
No jesting, hussy; did not I bring all my family into this retired part of the country, that we might not be plagued with his visits, and that he might not even know where to find us?

Car.
Yes, papa; and it being so retired a part of the country, I wished for Mr. Heartwell to keep me company.

Cad.
Why, you impudent -- harkye, hussy, hav'nt I done all this to make you happy?

Car.
I don't know, papa; we differ strangely in our ideas of happiness.

Cad.
How, minx! ar'nt I always trying to make you happy, if you would be so: but I can't persuade you to be happy in my way; hav'nt I found for you, here in the country, a suitable husband in Mr. Lenitive -- a sensible, reputable, agreeable -- 

Car.
Heigho!

Cad.
There again! Why, hussy, one would think I was asking you to take his physic instead of him.

Car.
Why, indeed, papa, his physic is the most agreeable of the two; and, you know, this Mr. Lenitive -- 

Cad.
Is a man after my own heart -- so don't say a word against him; you know what a value I have for him; you'll thank me the longest day of your life, for procuring you such a husband. Oh! here he comes; now let me see how well you can behave to him.

Enter Lenitive , L.

Len. (L.)
Mrs. Caddy, your most devoted -- Mr. Caddy, I'm your's -- my charming, amiable Miss Caroline, your most enslaved. You seem divinely well this morning -- your looks are the very syrup of roses. You're a happy man, Mr. Caddy, in being the father of such a sweet young lady. I protest, the very sight warms my heart like a cardamum.

Car. ( R. ) [Aside.]
Filthy fellow! Mr. Lenitive, your love always puts one in mind of your shop.

Len.
Oh, damn the shop! Why, what did I say, miss? did I speak about my shop?

Car.
Yes: you compared me to a drug, and said I warmed your heart like a cardamum.

Len.
Did I? Oh, plague on my apothecary's vocabulary!

     [Retires up.

Cad. (C.)
Harkye, miss: if you're come back to your senses, I advise you to look on Mr. Lenitive as your husband that is to be; and, if you have not yet recovered 'em, I'll send him to ye as a physician.

Car.
Oh, papa, I'll take him as a physician.

Cad.
Why, you're not ill, are you?

Car.
No; but I soon should be, if he were my husband; and then I must take him for both.

Cad.
Caroline, I'm ashamed of ye.

Len.
Pardon me, Mr. Caddy. Pray, Miss Caroline, -- I long to tell her of my good fortune -- she'd run into my arms -- but mum! Pray, Miss Caroline, if I may make bold to feel the pulse of your inclinations, what can you find to dislike in me?

Car.
Why, I dislike you in the whole. Is not that enough?

Len.
But what do you dislike about me in particular?

Car.
Why, I don't like your wig.

Len.
My wig! don't like my wig! fanciful enough! Well, that perhaps time -- how I long to tell her -- but mum! I shall surprise 'em this afternoon. But what else do you dislike?

Car.
I don't like your coat.

Len.
Don't like my coat! my wig and my coat! My dear Miss Caroline, perhaps -- I say no more at present. But perhaps time may mend 'em.

Car.
Then I don't like your face.

Len.
Oh, damn it! time won't mend that.

Cad.
Dear Mr. Lenitive, excuse this girl -- she's young and foolish at present. Caroline, a'nt you ashamed of yourself? Mr. Lenitive's dress is suited to his profession.

Len.
Profession -- fogh! I can't bear to hear it mentioned.
[Aside.]
I'll go directly to Whispstitch, the tailor, and equip myself in the pink of the mode. Mr. Caddy, you'll excuse me -- particular business. Miss Caroline, suffer me from those bright eyes to take one emollient draught of comfort -- plague on the words of my shop! they stick to my tongue like a blister.

     [Going.

Cad.
But, Mr. Lenitive, you won't forget the bonze?

Len.
HÃ¦ret lateri, Mr. Caddy; I'll set instantly in motion.

Cad.
You'll think of me?

Len.
Oh, mihi post nullos Caddi memorandi sodales -- 2, 5, 3, 8.

     [Exit, with Mrs. Caddy, L.

Cad.
There, now! there's a husband for ye! None of your Heartwells for me. Harkye, did not you send word to Heartwell of the place we are retired to?

Car.
Me, papa? not I.

Cad.
Come, I know you did -- you have no regard to the pains I take to make you happy. I wonder, if I was to disinherit you for your perverseness, whether Heartwell would travel as far to find you.

Car.
Yes, papa, I'm sure he would -- because -- 

Cad.
Ah, because why, pray?

Car.
Because he told me so himself.

Cad.
That's a good reason, indeed! No, no, I fancy we should not be troubled with many of his visits then.

Car.
Nor Mr. Lenitive's, either.

Cad.
Now, don't make me angry, or I'll disinherit you in earnest, and leave your fortune to your cousin Clara, who is expected here in a few days.

Car.
Now, my dear papa, I have hit on a scheme, which you must assist me to put in practice: after which, if you desire it, I am willing to marry Mr. Lenitive.

Cad.
A scheme! nonsense! what scheme is it?

Car.
Only to inform Mr. Heartwell and Mr. Lenitive that you have disinherited me, and settled your fortune on my cousin Clara; then suffer me to pass for her.

Cad.
Well?

Car.
Then we make trial of 'em both, and find which is the most disinterested; and see who's in the right, you or I.

Cad.
What, and if Heartwell makes love to the supposed cousin -- 

Car.
I'll marry Lenitive as soon as you please.

Cad.
Ah, you little fool; then you'll be married tomorrow morning.

Car.
Very well.

Cad.
But you don't consider, that Clara has been so long in France, she has more than half forgot the use of her native tongue; how, then, will you pass for her, without being discovered.

Car.
Nothing more easy: 'tis only dressing myself out like an opera-dancer, tossing my head about, and imitating the French.

Cad.
Harkye, Caroline: you may imitate your cousin's affectation, and toss your head about as much as you please; but, as long as I have a leg to stand on, I promise

ye none of my family shall ever imitate the French.

Car.
My dear papa, don't misconceive me: I mean to disguise myself, only by an exposition of their folly; for, however I may copy their ridicule in this scheme I have in my head, my heart is of true English growth, I assure ye.

Cad.
Well, I like the bargain well enough; I'll send to Lenitive and Heartwell directly; do you get yourself ready, and mind our agreement.

     [Exit, L.

Car.
That I will, most rigidly; but, if my plot fails, I'll willingly relinquish all hopes of happiness with my lover.

SONG. -- Caroline .

Oh, dear delightful skill,
The wily part to play,
And lead the swain at will -- 
I think I know the way.
With tears and sighs
I'll now surprise;
Now pleas'd awhile,
With smiles beguile,
And fairly gain the day -- 
For I think I know the way,
While mistress of my art,
Each rule I know so pat,
To sway a lover's heart -- 
Leave me alone for that.

At school, when all would try
Our governess to cheat,
Then who so well as I
Could manage the deceit?
With look so sly,
No, sure, not I;
Dear ma'am, not me;
It could not be!
You know I'm too discreet -- 
Dear ma'am, it could not be, &c.
     [Exit, R.

END OF ACT I.

ACT II.

SCENE I.

-- Caddy's Museum.

Enter Mr. and Mrs. Caddy , R.

Cad.
Poor Caroline, this matter will soon be settled -- she'll scarcely go from her word, and I'm sure of Lenitive. So, thank heaven, my girl will be happy at last in the way I would have her.

     [A noise without, L.

Mrs. C.
Hey-dey! what is all that noise on the staircase?

Enter Servant, L.

Ser.
Sir, Mr. Lenitive's compliments to you and Miss Caroline, and he has sent two cases.

Cad.
Ay, my dear, he sent me word he hoped to present me with a second case, which I should esteem a no less valuable curiosity than the first: another bonze, I suppose. This is a son-in-law after my own heart -- no fopperies, no fineries. Oh, here they come.
Enter four Men, with two mummy-cases, which they set down, one, R. , the other, L. , and exit, L.

And here's Mr. Lenitive -- eh! no, it's Label!

Enter Label , dressed exactly as Lenitive, L.

Cad.
Why, friend, I was in hopes of seeing your master.

Lab.
Master, sir! master! Sir, Mr. Lenitive will be here presently. Any complaints in the family, sir? As Mr. Lenitive is retiring from business, I should be glad to be employed during the residuum of your days, sir. You may depend on constant attendance, reasonable bill, and a copia medicinorum, optimorum, and sanctissimorum.

Cad.
Constant attendance! Why, dam'me, sir, d'ye think I mean to bespeak disorders as I do my shoes, and be ill by the year? Get out of my sight directly!

Lab.
An old frump!
[Aside.]
but he's a good customer, and so -- 

     [Muttering, and retiring up, L.

Cad.
An impudent puppy! His master retiring! No, no, his master is not such a fool. Now, my dear, let me see. Oh, lord! here's Heartwell -- plague on him for coming just at this moment! He sha'nt have a sight of the Chinese bonzes, though I long to see 'em myself -- but they are too sacred for the eyes of a fop.

Enter Heartwell , in regimentals, L.

Cad. (C.)
Heartwell, your servant.

Hea.
Is it possible, sir, I can be so fortunate as -- 

Cad.
I guess what you are going to say, sir; but you can't guess what I'm going to say to you, and so I'll tell you. You must know, sir -- you'll be surprised -- but Caroline's perverse behaviour has, at last, induced me to transfer my affections to my niece Clara, to whom I have made over all the fortune I formerly designed for Caroline.

Hea.
How, sir! -- disinherited your own daughter!

Cad.
Yes, sir; disinherited my own daughter; I suppose I may do what I will with my own? Oh, ho! -- what, that alters the case, does it?

Hea.
Sir, if you meant only to insult me -- 

Cad.
Insult you! No, sir; I sent for you, only out of respect to you.

Hea.
Sir!

Cad.
Sir! yes, sir; I sent for you, to offer you my niece Clara's hand, if you chuse her, instead of Caroline's; why, you'd scarce know one from the other, except that Clara is more accomplish'd, from having been educated abroad, and not so homely as Caroline.

Hea.
How, sir! Do you think to make sport of me, like an idiot? Be assured, sir, your niece's accomplishments are no object to me. But, where is my dear Caroline? No force shall keep her from me! Her poverty shall be my pride; and the profit of my commission, though small, shall be lavished on her, and every effort strained to make her as happy as her merit deserves; and so, sir, your servant.

     [Exit, L.

Cad.
Oh, your servant, sir. What, I suppose he'd persuade me that, if he was rich, he'd marry Caroline without a fortune. But I know the world too well. But now, my dear Mrs. Caddy, how I long to see 'em.
[Opens the case, R. , and discovers a black, deform'd, Chinese joss.]
There's No. 1, -- I never saw a greater beauty! It's enough to frighten one to look at it. What awe it inspires! Ay, ay, this is the pride of my intended son-in-law; he's fonder of this than the whole female race. Now Heartwell's a fool; fond of nothing but wine, women, and such trumpery, -- no sense, no taste. Now, if the other be but as great a curiosity; if No. 2 -- 

     [Opens the case, L. -- Lenitive bolts out, with the lottery-ticket in his hand, in a new suit.

Len.
Number 2, 5, 3, 8! Bought at Richardson and Goodluck's, Charing Cross, opposite the man upon the black horse.

Cad.
Why, what the devil is all this, Mr. Lenitive?

Len.
Mr. Caddy, fortune, who too often confers her favours blindly, has this day displayed her superior taste, by selecting me for her favourite. I come in this manner to offer to your family an estate of ten thousand pounds, principal money. Of the many cases I have been engaged in, I have come out of this in the most brilliant manner.

Cad.
Ah, I had rather have had another old bonze.

Len.
I flatter myself this humour of mine, breaking out quite in a new vein -- this dress -- 

Cad.
Dress! Why, you look like a tom fool. Why, what the deuce do you mean by this little jacket?

Len.
Little jacket! Why, that's my great coat.

Cad.
Great coat!

Len.
Yes, great coat; everybody wears these.

Cad.
Why, who the deuce makes such great coats?

Len.
Who? Why, Whipstitch, the London tailor.

Cad.
Whipstitch; where does he live?

Lab. [Coming down, L. ]

On the skirts of the town.

Len.
But where's the charming young lady, Mr. Caddy, who has the honour to be your niece?

Cad.
What, you heard all about it, then, while you were in the case?

Len.
With astonishment.

Cad.
Ay, I have my reasons for it; and, egad! I suspect one more than I thought. Well, what say you? Caroline without a fortune, or Clara with one? I give you your choice -- that is, provided you return to your old coat and wig.

     [Exit Caddy, R.

Len.
Pardon me, Mr. Caddy; pray drop the idea of the old coat and wig; the stomach turns at the bare remembrance.

DUET . -- Lenitive and Label .

Len.
From my hide-and-seek chin,
Sometimes out, sometimes in,
How flashy my muslin cascade is!
The pulse no more I squeeze,
But softly as you please,
I now squeeze the hand of the ladies.

Lab.
To all who complain,
Here I hold out my cane,
For Label a knight of the trade is;
No hand so fair to me
As the hand that holds a fee,
And I care not a pin for the ladies.

Len.
See my gold cane and wig
I've hung upon a peg,
Hic coestus uterque repono;
Gentility's my plan,
And I leave my journeyman
To the care of the publico bono.

Lab.
The world if you try,
First of doctors am I,
For ills that I know, and I don't know:
Deny it if you can,
Little Label is the man
To take care of the publico bono.
     [Exeunt -- Lenitive, R. Label, L.

SCENE II.

-- Another Chamber at Caddy's.

Enter Heartwell , L.

Hea.
I'll not leave the house till I find this apothecary; at his shop, they assured me he was here; besides, in waiting, I may have a chance of seeing my dear Caroline. Eh! who comes here?

Enter Lenitive , R.

Len.
Cousin! Caroline -- take the cousin instead of Caroline, -- love is a very pretty ingredient in a match, to be sure; but love and fortune make a much pleasanter mixture.

Hea.
Your servant, sir.

Len.
Whom have we here? Heartwell again! Zounds! how he's recovered since I left him; he certainly has not taken his physic.

Hea.
Eh! is that my rival, yonder? He's strangely altered in his appearance. Your servant, sir.

Len.
Sir, your servant.

Hea.
May I presume to ask, sir, if your name is not Lenitive, the apothecary?

Len.
Lenitive, sir! Luke Lenitive, Esq. at your service, but apothecary no more.

Hea.
I hear, sir, that Mr. Caddy has some thoughts of marrying his daughter to you.

Len.
You hear so -- 
[Laughing.]
He, he, he! I believe, sir, there may be some thoughts of such a thing.

Hea.
Have you the lady's consent, sir?

Len.
The lady's consent.
[Laughing.]
Ha, ha, ha! egad, that's pleasant enough! I should think any one that look'd at my figure -- 

Hea.
Your figure's as ridiculous as I conceive your pretensions to be; you look, to me, like -- 

Len.
Like what, sir?

Hea.
Like an apothecary.

Len.
The devil I do!

Hea.
And let me advise you, Mr. Apothecary, to be cautious how you proceed; or you'll have more business to settle than you are aware of.

Len.
Sir, I've left off business. But pray, Captain, have you any right to prescribe to me? I've got ten thousand pounds in my pocket; that's more than every gentleman of the army can boast.

Hea.
Harkye, Mr. Whippersnapper: if you suffer Mr. Caddy to lay the least restraint on his daughter's inclinations, the only choice I shall leave you will be, the length of your ground for pistol-shot.

Len.
Egad! then I'll chuse a sufficiently long one.

Hea.
But, why do I talk of a pistol to a fellow who deserves to be pounded in his own mortar.

Len.
Let me advise you, sir, to be on your guard, how you insult a gentleman with such language -- Whippersnapper, indeed! You'll find, sir, that, if once I take hold of a pistol -- 

Hea.
A pistol! -- A pestle, you mean.

Len.
No, sir, a pestle -- I mean a pistol -- pistol! I say, sir, if once I take a pestle -- a pistol, I mean -- 

Hea.
There, you see, now -- 

Len.
Plague of my tongue! I say, sir, if once I take hold of a pistol -- 

Hea. [Laughing.]
Ha, ha, ha!

Len.
What d'ye laugh at, sir?

Hea.
I beg your pardon, sir; but I was thinking, as I have escaped safe from your medicines, I need not be much afraid of anything else I can receive from you: you'll remember my advice. Your most obedient, Doctor Apothecary.

     [Exit, L.

Len.
Doctor Damnation! Oh, that ever I should have been an apothecary! Ecod! it would be a neat trick enough to take the cousin, and fob this copper captain off with a girl without a sixpence; see who'll laugh then. Doctor, indeed! I'll doctor him! Oh, here is Mr. Caddy. Well, sir, what news of the young lady?

Enter Caddy , R.

Cad.
Take care of your heart, Mr. Lenitive. Egad, she'll make a conquest of you. -- I have a great mind to give him a hint of the trick.
[Aside.]
Yonder she comes; d'ye see her; she's as like Caroline as one nankeen beaker is like another.

Len. [Crosses to R. , and looks through his glass.]
Egad! as you say, they're as like as two pills out of the same box.

Cad.
D'ye think she's as handsome?

Len.
Handsomer.

Cad. [Aside.]
I don't like that. But Caroline is the better match, for all that: well, here she comes -- I'll leave ye together -- but remember, you had better take Caroline.

     [Exit, L.

Len.
Take Caroline without a fortune! no -- marriage without money is, as the song says, "bitter to swallow, and hard of digestion."

Enter Caroline , R.

Car. [Skims across.]
Ah, mon cher ami, le joli garÃ§on!

Len.
Egad! this is the very thing for me! quite the shape for a man of my fortune -- how lucky that I'm a gentleman! I wish she spoke English, though, that I might understand her.

Car. (C.)
Ah, Monsieur Lenitive, comme il est beau -- 

Len.
A beau! yes, I am that: she's struck with my figure -- yes, she has a good taste -- egad! she's the first person I've found in the house who has any.

Car.
Ah, monsieur, qu'il est beau -- 

Len.
Kill a beau! No, miss; I've cured many, never killed one in all my life. -- Oh, she means that I shall die for love of her. -- Yes, lovely charmer, in that your charms are more dangerous than medicine -- they are sufficient to unnerve the fibres of the strongest heart, pierce the integuments of the pericordium, and penetrate quite through the solids into the medulla. Zounds! this unlucky jargon is always at my tongue's end.

Car.
Monsieur, you speak to me of physic.

Len.
Ah, she has smelt me out. I must alter my system -- pray, Miss Clara, did you ever see me before?

Car.
Oui, tres souvent.

Len.
What's that you say, miss?

Car.
Je parle FranÃ§ois.

Len.
No, miss, I don't parley in FranÃ§ois.
[Aside.]
Damn it, that's unlucky, too, now I'm a gentleman!

Car.
Parle Italiano?

Sed.

No, miss, I don't speak French at all.

Car. [Aside.]

No, I believe all languages are alike to him.

Len.
What d'ye say, miss?

Car.
Que vous Ãªtes charmante.

Len.
No, nor German: I speak all the dead languages but French and Jarman.

Cor.

Ah, vous ne m'aimez pas.

Len.
No, miss, it's you have maimed me in the heart, and must now be my physician.

Car.
Ah, I fear you no love a me.

Len.
I entreat you, miss, to throw off those fears. 
[Kneels.]
Suffer me to assure you, miss, that nothing can root out my passion; I am positive that neither change of air or diet could give me the smallest relief. No, miss, the fever of love is so strong upon me, that I'm certain sixteen grains of James's powders would have no more effect than -- 
[Aside.]
Damn it, I'm nailed to the counter like a bad shilling.

Car.
Ah, pitie pauvre Caroline, who will be so much disappoint of so sweet a gentilhomme.

Len.
Oh dear, no; disappointment perhaps may disorder her stomach, occasion bile -- but that's all. -- I'll venture to assert that a little sal polychrest and rhubarb, taken regularly, three table-spoonsful four or five times a day -- 
[Aside.]
Zounds! I've got into my shop again!

Car.
You see my cousin no more, den?

Len.
Oh, your cousin, miss, would not have done for me at all -- very well in the country, but would not do to hang upon my arm in the great world. But when we

go to London, we shall see the Italian Opera, and hear Mounseer Browni, Signor Kelly, Madame Mary, and Signora Scratchi; and then we shall visit all the polite places, Vauxhall Gardens, the Colosseum, Zoological Gardens -- 

Car.
Ah, you make de belle figure.

Len.
A figure! oh, yes, 2, 5, 3, 8, for that.

Car.
Vil you dance a chaccone vid me?

Len.
Pray excuse me, miss.
[Aside.]
I never danced in my life, except after my patients.

Car.
Vill you sing?

Len.
No, miss; when I sing -- I -- I don't often sing, and when I do they -- they -- 

Car.
Ah, moque de vous!

Len.
Yes, they smoke me -- they laugh at me.

Car.
If you please I sing a you de canzonet and grand air from de Opera at Paris.

Len.
Oh, lord, ay -- that must be charming.

SONG -- Caroline.

[Sung to the height of burlesque and ridicule.]

Beaux yeux, qui causez mon trepas
Revenez en ces lieux pour finir mon martire,
Depuis votre depart je languis je soupire,
Quand vous me dites good bye jusque au revoir,
How grieve mon coeur leave me en dessespoir,
Farewell plaisir, nojoy till votre retour,
Ah! pitie quelque unto my tendre amour.
Je meurs pour vos divins appas et je n'ose.

Len.
O, charming! such melody! such words!
[Aside.]
Though, damme! if I understood one of them.

     [Retires up -- soothing Caroline.

Enter Caddy , followed by Juba , with a letter, L.

Cad.
Don't ask me about your master.

Juba.
Oh me so glad, so glad! Massa no here?

Cad.
No, I tell you. He has been gone this half-hour.

Juba.
Den me find him: dis letter make my massa so happy.

     [Exit, L.

Cad. (L.)
Well, Mr. Lenitive, how d'ye find yourself? What, you're smitten, are you?

Len. (C.)
Oh, enchanted!

Cad.
And you are willing to take Clara instead of my daughter, are you?

Len.
With raptures! My dear Mr. Caddy, there's as much difference between her and your daughter, as between honey and hiera picra. Miss Clara has more wit, more life, more spirit, more air, more -- every thing -- she is sal volatile itself.

Cad. [Aside.]
Now, if it was not for the Chinese bonze he gave me, I could kick him. Heyday! Heartwell here again!

Enter Heartwell , with a letter, L.

Cad. (L. C.)
Well, what do you come for now, sir?

Hea.
I return to you with a heart panting with hope: the intelligence I have here received enables me to offer Miss Caroline, with my hand, a fortune superior to that which was once her own. I am ready to take her without a shilling, and only request to receive her from your hand.

Car.
My dear papa, who's in the right now?

Hea.
How, Caroline?

Len. (R.)
What, Caroline?

Cad.
Yes, this was all a trick of Caroline's; but you had not sense enough to see it, you son of a gallipot.

Len.
So, I've made a pretty job of it.

     [They go up -- Caroline, Heartwell, and Caddy, converse in dumb show.

Enter Label , with a letter, L.

Lab.
Mr. Lenitive, here's another letter for you, brought to my shop from the lottery-office.

Len.
Oh, they've sent me a draft for the money; well, this will console me for the loss of credit.
[Reads.]
" Sir -- We are sorry to be under the disagreeable necessity of " -- What's all this! " of apologizing to you for the unfortunate mistake of a figure in your lottery-ticket, which was not the number of the prize, but was immediately afterwards drawn ."Damnation! my prize is a blank!

Omnes.
A blank!
[Laughing.]
ha, ha, ha!

Lab.
How, sir, a blank!

Len.
There's a mistake in a figure!

Lab.
What, in 2, 5, 3, 8?

Len.
Oh, curse 2, 5, 3, 8! I'll tell you what, Label, I'll have my coat and wig again.

Lab.
No, you don't, though -- I'm in possession, and that you know -- 

     [Runs off, L.

Len. [Snatching at Label's wig, as he runs. off.]
I will have my wig, if I get nothing else.

Yes, I'll now resume pill, pestle, potion, powder, drop,
And all the former jargon of my shop;
Return to Galen, Celsus, Hippocrates,
Since now a gallipot my whole estate is;
With lotteries now for ever I'll have done,
Forget 2, 5, 3, 8, and stick to number one.

FINALE.

Car.
The changeling's fate we've set to view.
Our own depends alone on you;
To-night if we your smiles obtain,
We've drawn the prize we sought to gain.

Chorus.
With anxious hearts we look about,
To see if prize or blank come out;
More vain of you than fortune kind,
Since you can see, and she is blind.

THE END.
