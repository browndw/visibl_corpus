ACT I.

SCENE I.

 -- The Bay of Palermo. -- Fishing-Boats and Pleasure-Vessels moving in every direction over the Waves. Three Fishermen, who are about to push off their Boat, come forward.

GLEE -- Fishermen.

Ply the oar, brother, and speed the boat; 
Swift o'er the glittering waves we'll float; 
Then home as swiftly we'll glide again, 
Laden with wealth of the plunder'd main. 
Pull away, pull away! row, boys, row! 
A long pull -- a strong pull -- and off you go. 

Hark, how the neighb'ring convent-bell 
Throws o'er the waves its sullen swell. 
Slowly it comes from shore to shore, 
Blending it s chime with the dash of the oar. 
Pull away, pull away! row, boys, row! 
A long pull -- a strong pull -- and off you go! 
 [Exeunt Fishermen, in the boat, R. U. E. 

Enter Wildlove , in a gondola, L. U. E. , which reaches the landing-place as the fishing-boat disappears. He leaps out of it with animation, followed by the gondoliers.

Wild.
On terra firma once again! -- fairly ferried from elysium back again to earth. There, ye Charons of Palermo's Bay, mark how an Englishman pays you for the use of his own element.

 [Gives money to the Gondoliers. 

Gond.
Huzza! Long live the Englishman!

 [Exeunt, huzzaing, in the gondola, L. U. E. 

Enter Claudian , R.

Clau.
Ah! my mad, merry English friend, well encountered! What magnet could have drawn thee t'other side our bay? Have you been ranging in the gardens of Belvidere?

Wild.
Rather say, in the gardens of Eden, where a woman and the devil have been too much for man. Ah! you rogue, such fortune! such adventure! Imagine me warm from an interview with the daintiest piece of provocation that ever yet was lodged in flesh and blood! Oh! the prettiest, wittiest creature! -- I have squeezed her hand! -- I've pressed it to my lips! -- there's rapture, my boy! -- Ah! such a hand!

Clau.
Canst thou find nothing about a lady's person better worth praising than her hand? What are her figure and her features?

Wild.
Miraculous and incomparable both; I tell thee, man, she's a bona roba .

Clau.
Nay, but pr'ythee, be more particular. Are her eyes black, blue, or hazel?

Wild.
Eh! why, I'll engage their colour is one out of the three.

Clau.
What sort of nose has she?

Wild.
Let me see. Her nose -- it must be either a Grecian, a Roman, or a snub.

Clau.
I find you are resolved to conceal your mistress.

Wild.
Because my mistress is resolved to be concealed from me. Listen, rogue, and I'll communicate; five evenings since, I first encountered my incognita at the masquerade of a woman of rank. She wore the disguise of a gipsy; a certain je ne scai quoi about her shape and air caught my gad-about of a heart at the first glance: we danced together. In fine, she electrified me with her hand, bewildered me through her feet, and put my whole reserve of reasonable man hors de combat by her tongue.

Clau.
Wouldn't she show her face at last?

Wild.
No; but maintained the fire from her masked battery through the night. I stood the shot manfully, till she talked of parting, and then I honestly told her I must be left for dead upon the field of battle, unless she promised me a second interview. The public gardens of Belvidere were named; and there, upon each succeeding day, have I rencountered with my charmer about the hour of noon.

Clau.
Well, but as it is not carnival time, she surely doesn't wear a mask by day?

Wild.
Aye, but a mystifying black veil of most duenna-like thickness muffles every charm as obscurely as would a total eclipse the moon. No prayers can lift it from her brow.

Clau.
How many interviews have you yet had?

Wild.
Five!

Clau.
And what have you done with her at either of them?

Wild.
Nothing.

Clau.
How! meet a woman five times, and not be civil to her once? That may be modesty in England, captain; but cursed ill manners over all the rest of the world.

Wild.
Nay, nay; I'm no shame-faced Master Jacky upon occasions; but a woman of reputation, you know -- 

Clau.
Is to be won by pretty much the same process as the rest of her sex. Couldn't you lie and swear?

Wild.
Abundantly; but, though my lies were very good ones, they wanted novelty to charm; for she plainly told me the same things had been said to her by twenty lovers before. Then, as for my oaths, though I twanged them off roundly, they did not belong to a religion that pleased her. I swore by Cupid; but she only registers by Hymen.

Clau.
Couldn't you change your faith, to oblige a lady's scruples?

Wild.
What! consent to drag about these free limbs in fetters? No; though Mammon forged the chain of massive gold, and beauty twisted every link with roses. Expect an Englishman to resign his liberty? My good fellow, 'tis only a foreigner could have asked the question; besides, I have a second mistress upon my hands, with whom I am in love to a parallel distraction.

Clau.
Heyday! a second incognita?

Wild.
Aye, a second: fifty-fold more mysterious and inexplicable than the first -- a thing of air -- a creature of the elements, that comes to me whistling through the keyhole with the wind, and departs up the chimney in the smoke -- that sits vis-a-vis to me in my chamber, without my seeing her -- takes my arm when I walk abroad without my feeling her -- hears all I say -- watches everything I do -- hovers somewhere round me wherever I move; and I actually believe makes an invisible third in our company at this very moment.

Clau.
Pshaw! you are jesting with me.

Wild.
Never more serious. You are well acquainted with the house where I lodge?

Clau.
Assuredly; it adjoins the residence of our family. I know the people who keep it to be severely honest, and 'twas by my recommendation that you occupy their apartments.

Wild.
Well, sir, I have found letters upon my table of a morning which must have been left there in the middle of the night, after my doors were fastened, yet not a lock was disturbed. I have written answers, and placed them on the same spot; these have been spirited away, whilst I had only quitted the room for an instant to walk in the antechamber.

Clau.
And the nature of these billets? Love, I suppose.

Wild.
A little of that; but a plaguy deal more of mischief. This Lady Nobody has acquired a perfect understanding of all my secrets; not a kiss have I stolen from any good-natured wench, though never so privately, for the last fortnight, but the fine ear of this fairy has tingled with the smack of it: nay, the very conversation between our two selves, when you praised the beauty of your widow-cousin, and I ridiculed her insipidity, was recapitulated, chapter and verse, by my nameless correspondent, within half an hour after its occurrence.

Enter Jeremy , hastily, L.

Jer.
Oh, master of mine, have I found you at last? I have run up and down the streets, right and left, cross hands, change sides, cast off, up the middle and down again, for the last two hours, in pursuit of you. Ugh! ugh! I'm out of breath.

Wild.
Why, rascal, didn't I order you to remain in my apartment till -- 

Jer.
Don't mention it, sir; the very thought of that damnable apartment bathes my whole state of man in a lily dew of apprehension: never let us return to it again, sir. 'Tis King Belzebub's own particular drawing-room, and, let a Christian be never so much in love, he ought not to go to court there.

Wild.
Cowardly blockhead! who has been in the lodging to terrify you?

Jer.
Witches and sorcerers -- Mother Shipton, Doctor Faustus, and the Bottle Conjurer. Oh! such infernal pranks! It's gone, sir.

Wild.
Speak coherently. What's gone.

Jer.
The letter -- the letter, sir.

Wild.
That which I left upon my table this morning, in answer to the unknown? Well, by whom was it taken?

Jer.
Truly, sir, I didn't see the person; but I shrewdly suspect it to have been the devil.

Wild.
'Sdeath! foiled again! -- Rascal! wasn't it my positive command that you should watch, without intermission, till my return?

Jer.
And watch I did, Sir; the very lynx never brooded on his prey so narrowly. I seated myself close to the table, the very moment you went abroad. For the first quarter of an hour, I read one of the religious books I brought out with me from England -- 'Every Gentleman his own Valentine Writer.' Nobody came, and I grew tired of study. For the next quarter of an hour I twiddled my thumbs, an innocent recreation, but still nobody came, and that failed me too; for a third resource, I tried the devil's tatoo; this, I thought, might be taken as a delicate signal by somebody to call for the letter; but no -- not even a mouse stirred or scratched at the wainscot. At last, just as I was about devising a fourth budget of ways and means to carry on the war against time, the little black-eyed chambermaid tapped at the door. 'Mr. Jeremy, Punchinello's in the street; won't you step to the balcony of next room and take a peep?' Black eyes and Punchinello your honour! was it in mortal to resist?

Wild.
And so, rascal -- 

Jer.
And so, sir, a woman and folly seduced poor Jeremy from his duty, as they often had his betters before him. But I double-locked the door, carried the key upon my finger, as fast as a bride would her wedding-ring. My absence did not last three minutes, the door in sight of me all the time; yet, when I returned, presto! the letter had vanished!

Wild.
Yet no trace -- no symptom of the visitor left behind?

Jer.
Yes; either my nostrils were at fault, or I sniffed an infernal smell of brimstone.

Wild.
A pestilence upon the place! thus to be eternally thwarted and tormented! Claudian, I shall certainly run mad with sheer vexation.

Clau.
Tush, man! this riddle is easily solved. Your chamber must have some secret mode of entrance.

Wild.
So thought I at first; but no, sir; I have searched it to the last cranny: there's no concealment for a trap-door in either floor or ceiling. I have pierced the wainscot which covers the sides of the room in every direction, and found solid wall behind it. The window is too lofty to be scaled; besides, that I have fastened of late equally with the doors; then the people of the house. No trick could be carried on without their knowledge, and you are bondsman for their honesty.

Clau.
I would wager my estate upon their faith. Well, if this conjecture err, I must needs acknowledge your adventure to be without parallel. In love with two women, and not know the face of either!

Wild.
But then, their minds -- their minds, you rogue!

Clau.
Aye, thine's a happy constitution for platonics, truly! However, incognita the first has at least a good figure.

Wild.
Oh! she's a delicious woman.

Clau.
But as for the second -- 

Wild.
She must be an angel!

Clau.
One of the fallen breed, then. Preserve us from hoofs and horns! And, pr'ythee, to which of these comical rivals does that madcap heart of thine incline its preference?

Wild.
They knock it, like a shuttlecock, backwards and forwards between them. By turns they animate, perplex, enrapture, and confound me. My system, now, is wound up to its last pitch of provocation, and I must catch one or both of my incognitas before night; or I shall fairly go off, like the cork from a Champagne bottle, blown up by too much effervescence.

Clau.
Then you persist upon this double chase?

Wild.
To the last breath, my boy. Walk with me to the next coffee-house, and I'll acquaint you with my plans. Jeremy, fly back to your post; we shall follow presently.

Jer.
Back to that hobgoblin chamber, and sit there alone? Have some commiseration, sweet master, upon an innocent young man.

Wild.
Obey me to the letter, sirrah! or beware the consequence. 
[Exit Jeremy, L. ]
Now, signor, allons .

That woman is a match for man, 'tis true; 
Yet single, I at once dare challenge two! -- 
Right English heart from odds ne'er felt alarms; -- 
'England alone against the world in arms!' 
 [Exeunt, R. 

SCENE II.

 -- A Chamber in Signor Rafael's House.

Enter Negombo , L.

Neg.
Oh! dis love, dis love, it be ruin to us all. Missey wise woman, whiles she no trouble about man; now she do foolish tings all day, dream foolish tings all night. Little naked boy wid no eyes, that buckra folk call Cupid, him do more hurt wid bow and arrow than Obi-woman wid all her charms; him shoot Negombo once; her poor heart still feel the pain like yesterday.

BALLAD -- Negombo .

Negombo ne'er forget the day 
When Yudah's loss befel; 
Me saw my true love torn away, 
Me heard his last farewell. 

Me ne'er forget the day 
When Yudah's loss befel; 
Me saw my true love torn away, 
Me heard his last farewell. 

O'er rolling wave, to distant clime, 
Tall ship my Yudah bore; 
But still thro' wave, and space, and time, 
Fond thought his form restore. 

Still, still, I see the crowded deck; 
In air the white sails swell; 
The vessel fades, a tiny speck, 
But still I hear farewell! farewell! 
Enter Signor Rafael , L.

Raf.
Negombo! hark ye, my tiny bit of tropical darkness, where's my niece, Zephyrina? where's thy lady?

Neg.
Good lady just come in doors.

Raf.
Negombo, come hither; nearer still -- close to my elbow.

Neg.
Massa, what you want at your elbow?

Raf.
Look here -- a shining ducat!

Neg.
Ah! me see now, you wicked old man; you want bad ting at your elbow.

 [Going, R. 

Raf.
Confound your dingy impudence! Come back, I say; I want nothing of you but truth.

Neg.
Then, massa, you give two ducats; poor servant can't afford to sell truth cheap.

Raf.
Here, take them. Now, then, for the secret. Has my niece any -- hey? Has she, I say? -- hem! You take my meaning? -- 

Neg. [Shaking her head.] 
No; me take nothing of old man, but his ducats.

Raf.
Thou spirit of obstinacy in full mourning! understand me now, then. Among all my niece's visitors, haven't you marked any one gentleman who approaches with a soft voice? -- who ventures a sly squeeze of her hand?

Neg.
Yes, massa; one do all that.

Raf.
Aye, my brave wench; I thought so. Now for it.

Neg.
One gentleman come every day wid soft voice like lady; he take hold of fingers just so; teach Missey go thrum, thrum.

Raf.
Her music master. 
[A guitar is touched behind, R. ]
That infernal twing-twang guitar! Oh! I must stop my ears.

Neg.
Negombo open her's twice wide, and save your's hear it.

Enter Zephyrina , with a guitar, R.

TRIO -- Zephyrina, Negombo , and Rafael .

Zeph. 
Blythe, oh! blythe, the sun-beams glowing, 
Wake the youthful heart to mirth; 
Perfum'd breezes round us blowing, 
Clear the heavens and fan the earth. 

Neg. 
Missey touch the string so sweetly, 
Oh! it joy my heart to hear. 

Raf. 
Cease, oh! cease that cursed strumming, 
Or you'll slay me thro' my ear! 

Zeph.
Make no more sour faces, darling old uncle. There -- 
[Gives the guitar to Negombo, who takes it off, L. , and returns]
 -- my poor offending guitar is dismissed; now be a good-natured man, and smile again.

Raf.
Ah! gipsy, there is a way to make me smile, and thou know'st it. Don't shake thy head so perversely; thou understand'st me well. Ah! if I might but live to celebrate a certain marriage.

Zeph.
By all means, uncle; I conjure you not to delay so laudable a design another hour. I'm all impatience to salute the lady you have selected for my aunt.

Raf.
Aunt, quotha! Why dost think I wish a marriage for myself?

Neg. [Coming forward, L. ] 
Yes, you marry, massa; me like to dance at your wedding.

Raf.
No, no; that project hath a marvellous unpromising face to it. But, Zephyrina, if thou could'st but be persuaded -- 

Zeph.
Didn't I, purely to oblige you, venture upon matrimony scarcely two years ago?

Raf.
Well, and thy kind husband went to heaven in the honeymoon, leaving thee a buxom widow with a swinging jointure in the Indies. Isn't that as pretty encouragement as woman could desire?

Zeph.
Stubborn fact, and an alluring example, I confess. Well, supposing for a moment I should be inclined to indulge you in this whim, which, however, is not the case, how can it be ascertained whether we should agree in our choice of a husband?

Raf.
Marry, hussy; -- only marry, and I care not if you make a husband of the Grand Turk.

Zeph.
What a dear, liberal, proper-thinking sort of old man you are! I vow I've a great mind to trust you with a secret.

Raf.
Do, do; I'll keep it like a confessor.

Zeph.
Why then, in honest frankness, I confide -- but no, I can't tell you -- my modesty forbids.

Raf.
Your modesty!

Neg.
Yes, massa, missey's modesty forbid.

Raf.
The devil fly away with both your modesties! 
[To Negombo.]
Get away with you, do! 
[Drives her out, L. Speak it out; I'm on the rack of suspense.

Zeph.
Must I? It's very shocking; but -- as I think I may trust you -- what think you of my cousin Claudian's friend, the English officer?

Raf.
An Englishman! St. George and his dragon for ever! But, pooh! impossible! -- you never were in his company above once; you met in my presence, and in this very room. I remember the occasion from one remarkable circumstance -- you held your tongue for a whole hour together!

Zeph.
Nevertheless he is sufficiently familiar with its tone by this time. The poor wretch hasn't a secret in the world, but I am privy to't; yet I arrived at all my knowledge without the trouble of quitting this house.

Raf.
Confound your circumlocution! come to the point.

Zeph.
I demur no longer. Hem! 'Chapter the first.' 'A note of interrogation.' Did not this mansion, and the house adjoining to it, originally compose one residence?

Raf.
Yes, yes. Our family purchased it as the palace of a foreign ambassador; but, finding the building too extensive for a private establishment, they parcelled off the superfluous portion, which, as thou knowest, is now occupied as an hotel.

Zeph.
Upon the third floor of which the aforesaid Englishman is a lodger. So far we agree. Now, mark me well: some time since, a whim seized me to remove the old-fashioned tapestry with which my dressing-room was hung; a secret door, closely nestled in the wall, presented itself: I pushed against it; it yielded; and, presto! I found myself in the lion's den! Presently, approaching footsteps warned me to retire; two men-creatures entered; they were my cousin and his friend; I could not help listening a little; and, oh lud! uncle, they talked so naughtily, that, if I hadn't been in the dark, I must positively have blushed myself into a fever!

Raf.
Gad-a-mercy! what was the topic?

Zeph.
Love -- unhallowed love! -- there my valiant Briton blustered forth in all his glory -- 'Marriage-knots were only twined for slavish souls; man was creation's chartered lord; and woman -- oh! the pretty easy fool! -- purely a plaything, made on purpose to amuse his idler hours.' I heard the wretch. 'War! war! war!' exclaimed the panting genius of my sex; and, upon the instant, revenge sprang from my brain, as Pallas did from Jove's, a full-grown goddess armed!

Raf.
Gadso! well, how didst thou commence hostilities?

Zeph.
By casting a hand-grenade into the enemy's quarters in the shape of a billet-doux from nobody. The consternation thus created by my pen has been delicious; however, I was resolved my tongue should share in the honours of the campaign.

Raf.
How! have you ventured to speak to him?

Zeph.
Aye; but under a second character; chance soon gave me that opportunity at a masquerade. In fact, I have fairly caught the enemy between two fires; and, unless he presently surrenders at discretion -- 

Raf.
A general blow-up must be the consequence; but if he does surrender, what will you do with the man?

Zeph.
Show him round the country in a cage, for the gratification of the curious; and at last, when the animal is properly tamed, perhaps I may fasten him to my side, by a light chain, for the rest of his life.

Raf.
Make a husband of him! Why, Zephy, Zephy, would'st thou marry a rake?

Zeph.
That would I, and purely because he is a rake: there's danger in the enterprize, and therefore, glory, uncle. But, uncle, you must be my ally.

Raf.
Must I? then pr'ythee let me furnish the corps de reserve .

Zeph.
Never fear; you'll not be called out on any dangerous service.

Raf.
There's my hand; the treaty's signed.

Zeph.
Now blessings on thee, for the best behaved old gentleman in Christendom!

Raf.
But remember; no dangerous service; let our watchword be prudence -- 

Zeph.
Courage, enterprize, and victory!

 [Exeunt, L. 

SCENE III.

 -- Wildlove's Lodgings. A large handsome Apartment; window lofty; a writing-table stands forward in the scene, covered with papers, &c. Ordinary articles of furniture are scattered about. The door of the entrance is closed. After a few seconds of silence, a key is heard to turn very slowly in the lock, and the door is opened by degrees.

Enter Jeremy , R. , his head a little advanced; he looks apprehensively around.

Jer.
St. Benedict strengthen, and go before me! Now would I sooner run upon errands into purgatory than pass the threshold of this infernal chamber. All seems quiet. May I venture? 
[He steals forward, halting at each pace, and glancing behind him at the door, which he has previously flung wide open.]
So far, so well; I feel my courage returning, and now -- 
[He inadvertently strikes his advanced leg against a chair and starts back in trepidation]
 -- Who's that? Stand off, Belzebub, or -- pshaw! 'twas only a chair! Whew! if I had walked into the crater of Vesuvius, I couldn't have perspired more profusely. Everything in the room seems exactly as I left it. Let me examine the table; any fresh bulletin from underground? No; all in statu quo . Ah! my master has left his snuff-box behind; I'll steal a pinch, to reinvigorate my nerves -- 
[Opens the box]
 -- empty! Gadso! I remember now; he ordered me to replenish it against his return; but these gambols of his infernal majesty have made me forget everything. Let's see; our landlord has a canister of curious Macabaw, so I can supply myself without quitting the house; perhaps, too, I can persuade the little black-eyed chambermaid to take pity upon my solitude, and -- gad! no bad thought -- on my knees, before an angel, I could defy the devil and all his works. Between the conception of a happy design and its execution no time should be lost.

 [Exit Jeremy, running, with the snuff-box, R. ; shutting the door after him and locking it. 

Enter Zephyrina , cautiously, L. , from a door in the wainscoting at the back, and steals forward.

Zeph. [Looking round.] 
Even as Negombo reported; all at my own disposal; let me try the door, however; right! 'tis fastly locked. 
[She peeps through the keyhole.]
The ante-room vacant also. Now, then, I may deposit my billet upon the table. 
[Draws a note from her pocket.]
Heyday! a volume folded down carefully. In the dear name of curiosity, what may be the nature of a rake's studies? Ha, Ovid! the heart's and nature's favourite bard! -- it opens at the page where Sappho bewails her Phaon's perfidy. Mighty palatable food for man's voracious vanity. But, captain, I'll variegate the text against you next refer to it. Yes, between these pages of the Lesbian muse, such a discovery will be delightful. Hark! wasn't that a step? -- a man's -- and already in the ante-room. Presto! I have but a moment left to save myself.

 [In the utmost confusion she thrusts the billet carelessly into the book, without looking at it, and flies through the secret door, which she closes as the unlocking the other is heard. 

Re-enter Jeremy from the door, R.

Jer.
Plague take the little jilt! -- can't find her. Women never in the way when we want them. Filled the snuff-box, however; -- devilish lonely here; -- what's to be done: -- here's pen, ink, and paper; suppose I scribble a few tender touching things to Sal Hartshorn, my lovely absent darling of Shepherd's Market? Aye, I can slip it into the next packet my master sends to England; but first I'll draw the table more into the light. 
[He pulls the table forward towards the front of the stage, and seats himself with his face to the audience.]
Now for a flight sublime!

 [He flings himself into a posture of meditation. 

Re-enter Zephyrina , cautiously, from the secret door, in the utmost agitation.

Zeph. [Aside.] 
Yes; his servant is in possession of the room, and I am lost! In my hurry, I have thrust the wrong billet into the book; my name and direction are on the cover; and if Wildlove once discovers it, my secret is betrayed, and I shall be laughed at and exposed for ever! Oh! fatal carelessness! -- ruinous mistake!

Jer.
Hang it! I can't hit upon a bright idea. Your great wits always take snuff, when they want to astonish; I can try a pinch now. 
[Takes snuff with much form.]
Umph! pretty mixture this; tastes well; deuced strong, though.

Zeph. [Aside.] 
Unless I can recover it, I shall be undone! The fellow's back is turned, and the book lies beyond his elbow, at the table's edge; if I could but steal behind him on tip-toe.

Jer.
Yes; I can manage a flourish or so, just to begin it; but my master and Signor Claudian will soon be here.

Zeph. [Aside.] 
My cousin and Wildlove expected together! then I must brave all hazards. My heart goes tic tac, like a repeating watch.

 [Zephyrina steals forward on tiptoe towards the table. Jeremy, supporting his chin with his left hand, and writing intently with the other, is entirely prevented from observing the book. 

Jer. [Writing.] 
'Adorable Miss Hartshorn' -- I've cut those letters as fine as copper-plate.

Zeph. [Aside.] 
Now, then, if he doesn't turn his head.

Jer.
Oh! for a thought, ye gods!

 [In breathless trepidation Zephyrina extends her hand to the table's edge, and lifts the volume; she opens it, and recovers the billet, which she eagerly thrusts into her bosom. 

Zeph. [Aside.] 
The prize is mine!

 [Zephyrina with tremulous action bends forward to replace the volume; Jeremy at that instant appears to catch the idea he has courted, and exclaims -- 

Jer.
I have it now! 
[Suddenly flinging out his left arm, as if to emphasize his rapture upon the table, his hand strikes inadvertently upon Zephyrina's, just as she is withdrawing it from the book; she shrieks; he starts and seizes her.]
What's that? a woman! Aye, by all the Muses, 'I have it now,' indeed. Pray, madam, are you a lady in earnest, or are you the devil in masquerade?

Zeph.
For heaven's sake, release me! I'll give you gold; I'll give you jewels.

Jer.
Ah! now I know you for the devil; since you begin your acquaintance with a bribe. No, no; I've laid birdlime for these mischievous fingers too long, to let them escape me now.

 [Wildlove and Claudian are heard speaking below, R. 

Wild. [Without, R. ] 
My man's above, d'ye say? follow me, Claudian.

Zeph. [Struggling in an agony of fright.] 
Distraction! ruin!

Jer.
Aye, your time's come. Holloa! master! Signor Claudian! landlord! house! holloa there! I've caught the devil in a trap: holloa!

 [Jeremy continues calling towards the door, holding Zephyrina fast by one hand, with his head turned from her; she, struggling, draws back against the table; suddenly the open snuff-box catches her eye, and she snatches at it with her disengaged hand. 

Zeph.
Nay, then, since I am the devil, look round upon me, and hold me if you dare.

Jer.
Hey! 
[He turns his head, and she instantly discharges the snuff-box against his eyes; he stamps violently, and loses his hold.]
Holloa! murder! darkness! blindness! holloa!

Wild. [Without, R. ] 
Cease your bawling, rascal! we're on the stairs.

 [Jeremy continues stamping and roaring; Zephyrina darts back to the secret door, exit, and closes it. 

Enter Wildlove, Claudian, Landlord , Waiters, Chambermaids, &c., in consternation, R.

FINALE.

Jer. 
Seize her! seize her! 

Wild. & Claud. 
 Who? seize who? 

Jer. 
That, the devil -- hold me -- tchew! 
 [Sneezes. 

Chorus. 
No one near is heard or seen, 
Tell us, pr'ythee, what you mean. 

Jer. 
Hear me, hear me -- tchew! tchew! tchew! 

Chorus. 
Look around; the chamber view. 

Jer. 
Hear me -- tchew! 

Chorus. 
 His wits have fled; 
How he sneezes! -- hold his head! 

Jer. 
Let me catch her. Zounds! I'm blind! 

Chorus. 
Tell us where the foe to find. 

Jer. 
Here, I've caught her! 
 [Seizes one of the maids. 

Girl. [Struggling.] 
Let me go! 

Chorus. 
Speak the name -- declare the foe! 
Nothing round we hear or see. 

Jer. 
'Twas the devil talk'd with me. 

Chorus. 
How! the devil! 

Jer. 
 Oh, my eye 

Chorus. 
Clear the chamber -- let us fly! 

Wild. 
Guard the chamber -- never fly! 
 [The characters mingle in confusion. Jeremy sneezes and staggers alternately from one side to the other, each pushing him away as he falls against them. The tumult and consternation are at the height as the curtain drops. 

END OF ACT I.

ACT II.

SCENE I.

 -- The Public Walks -- Garden Seats on.

Enter Wildlove and Claudian , R.

Wild.
Was ever such an incomprehensible petticoat heard of before? 'Sdeath! this is the scurviest trick she has played me yet.

Clau.
If a woman were really in the chamber, how she could escape from it without meeting us is, indeed, a miracle: yet Jeremy's story is scarcely to be questioned -- the poor devil's eyes were testimonies for his truth.

Wild.
To blind a man with snuff, and vanish in a sneeze! How a wench's wit, when bent upon mischief, thrives in these warm latitudes? But if I don't catch this water-wagtail before midnight -- 

Clau.
The trap you propose to lay for her has certainly a promise of success; but do not boast too loudly; remember, captain, there is a certain homely adage -- 

Wild.
'Noisy cats very seldom catch mice.' Verbum sat! -- King Solomon himself never held a proverb in stricter reverence; but never fear me, Jeremy is now dispatched upon the business, and while he prepares for one of my mistresses, I shall amuse myself by settling matters in person with the other.

Clau.
What! your incognita of the masquerade? Do you meet her this evening?

Wild.
Aye, meet, and bring her to terms before I part with her; half an hour before sun-set was our appointment. I'faith, 'tis near the time already.

Clau.
Nay, then, I'll not detain you by further questions. Adieu! I shall visit your hotel punctual to my promise

Wild.
Recollect, 'tis after dusk our snare is laid. Adieu!

 [Exit Claudian, R. 

Enter Zephyrina , closely veiled, L. U. E. , as if watching Claudian's departure.

Zeph. [Aside.] 
So yonder my well-behaved cousin bows himself out of sight; and now I may venture to drop my curtsey on the scene.

Wild. [Looking at his watch.] 
Let me see; -- to row across the bay will take me six minutes; from the landing-place to the gate of the Belvidere I can walk in two more; and then -- 

Zeph. [Taps him on the shoulder.] 
To the right about, captain, and salute your commanding officer.

Wild.
Ah! taken by surprise. Thus I present arms, my dear.

 [Attempts to embrace her. 

Zeph. [Eluding him.] 
Recover arms! take open order! stand at ease!

Wild.
Confound your discipline! Hark ye, child, you have me yet purely as a volunteer; and, if you play the Martinet, I shall certainly decline the service. But, pr'y-thee, from which of the stars has your abitrary ladyship now been pleased to drop?

Zeph.
Ah! you are no true son of Mars, or you would have sworn I had slipped from Venus without a question. But suppose I come ambassadress from the moon, to reclaim such stray lunatics as may be found wandering below. Captain, you bear the suspicious mark upon your forehead.

Wild.
Were I thy husband, child, that might chance to be the case; however, I'll e'en become the man in the moon to humour thee; so thou, its capricious Diana, wilt promise to use me upon earth like an Endymion rather than Actæon; come, let me escort thee to the Belvidere.

 [Passing his arm round her waist. 

Zeph. [Disengaging herself.] 
No; since we have met, 'tis as well we pass to an explanation where we are. Hark ye, captain, I want an honest answer to a plain question. Speak -- What do you intend to do with me?

Wild. [Aside.] 
Humph! that's a home thrust -- 'Mean to do with thee?' Take me to thy lodging, child, and thy curiosity shall be satisfied forthwith.

Zeph.
No; I'll have my satisfaction here.

Wild.
Isn't this walk too public?

Zeph.
Not for my purpose -- Speak! do you like me?

Wild.
Oh! to desperation: -- to distraction.

Zeph.
And dare you take me?

Wild.
To either quarter of the globe.

Zeph.
But for ever and aye; for better and for worse, even so long as both of us may live?

Wild.
Rather so long as both of us may love -- that's the honest, old-fashioned way of bargaining. Why should a brace of generous hearts like ours, upon opening a partnership account of pleasure, trouble the lawyer for articles of covenant? No, no, child, take my advice; let us trip together down love's flowery path with light unencumbered heels -- enjoy the minute -- catch the passing smile -- prattle, sing, and caper to each other, so long as mutual inclination prompts; then, if at last our spirits flag -- 

Zeph.
Why, 'tis but to change partners, and call a new dance. Oh! the theory of your system is delicious, yet I've a few old prejudices to adjust before I can make up my mind to its practice. In fact, captain, though I doat upon all kinds of dancing to excess, and could fancy you beyond most men for a partner, yet I'm a true Catholic, and must always think it necessary to begin a holiday by going to church.

Wild.
A plague upon thy superstition! but I'll shame thee out of it with pure argument.

Zeph.
You'll find me too much of a bigot to be made your convert. Come to the point, captain; can you love me well enough to marry me?

Wild. [Hesitating.] 
Positively, my dear, you put the awkwardest interrogatories -- 

Zeph.
Ha! perhaps you have some other mistress whom you love better?

Wild.
No, no -- you wrong me there.

Zeph.
For instance, the fair cousin of your friend, Signor Claudian.

Wild.
Ha! ha! ha! in love with that automaton?

Zeph.
Why, the woman's rich.

Wild.
Yes; but, as she forgot to show me her strong box, I'm still a stranger to her charms.

Zeph.
Don't you think her handsome?

Wild.
I believe she had a nose; but, 'faith, I looked the lady in the face only once, and then the solemn prudery of her aspect so froze me, that I couldn't summon up courage for a second peep.

Zeph.
Then I'm to suppose you absolutely free?

Wild.
As birds upon the wing.

Zeph.
Could I think you faithful also?

Wild.
Oh! a very turtle for constancy -- try me.

Zeph.
I will -- marry me.

Wild.
Nay, that would be condemnation before trial. Excuse me there.

Zeph.
I'm answered. All's over, captain, and I'm your humble servant.

 [Crosses. 

Wild. [Catching her hand.] 
Not so fast, my flying Daphne!

Zeph.
Let me pass; I've done with you, sir.

Wild.
And I'm about to begin with you, madam. Look ye, my dear, thou hast made an ass of me, with marvellous ingenuity, for any reasonable number of times; 'tis now my turn of the game, and, before we part, I'll make thee know me for thy natural lord and master.

Zeph. [Struggling.] 
Won't you behave to me like a gentleman?

Wild.
Very much so, if you'll give me time. Child, go whither thou wilt, thou shalt take an honest fellow in thy company to the world's end.

Zeph. [Aside.] 
Dear mother wit, aid me now or never! 
[She suddenly bursts into an immoderate fit of laughter.]
Ha! ha! ha!

Wild.
Hey day! what's the fit now?

Zeph.
Ha! ha! ha! you men are certainly the easiest creatures. My poor captain! so he thought I really meant to part with him? Heaven help the man! I design to plague him for at least a twelvemonth longer. There, take my hand; have with you for the Belvidere.

Wild.
Now thou'rt a generous wench, and I shall love thee heartily: I've a gondola in waiting.

Zeph.
Allons! then, for a merry voyage! 
[As they turn up the stage with animation, Zephyrina suddenly screams, and falls against Wildlove's arm.]
Ah! support me! hold me!

Wild.
What's the matter?

Zeph.
Oh! my head! my head! carry me to a seat! [Wildlove places her on a bench, R. Oh! it's a vertigo; everything swims -- swims round me!

Wild.
What a sudden attack!

Zeph.
It's in the family. My grandmother's old complaint; I had an aunt, Ursula, who died of it. There again! get me some sal volatile, or I shall faint.

Wild.
Where shall I run? where can I -- 

Zeph.
There's a chymist's shop at the end of the next walk. Quick, quick, or I expire!

Wild.
Don't think of it; I'll fly; I'll -- dear, exquisite, suffering, angelic creature!

 [Exit, L. , running, down the walk Zephyrina pointed out; she keeps her fainting posture for a few seconds, and then peeps quickly round. 

Zeph.
Yes, he's out of sight; the trees are fairly between us. Now, captain, catch me if you can!

 [Exit, hastily, L. U. E. 

Enter Jeremy , running, R. He throws himself upon the seat Zephyrina has quitted.

Jer. [Fanning himself with his hat.] 
Signor Claudian said he left my master in this walk. Ah! I've run to small purpose; no sign of him hereabouts. Well, then, as I can't expect to find him for this half hour, I may as good sit down and cool myself. The afternoon is confounded sultry; I declare I feel exactly as if I -- 

Re-enter Wildlove , running and out of breath, L.

Wild. [Thrusting a phial under Jeremy's nose.] 
Here, my angel, smell directly.

Jer. [Springing up.] 
The devil! my master!

Wild.
Jeremy! Why, where's the lady upon this seat?

Jer.
Truly, sir, a seat is here; but, as for a lady, she's neither here nor there.

Wild. [Collaring him.] 
Rascal! tell me instantly what you've done with her.

Jer.
Upon my soul, sir, I've done nothing with any lady to-day. Ah! you'll throttle me.

Wild.
Speak! Didn't you find a female fainting?

Jer.
Not I; perhaps she found this bench too hard, and left it to faint upon a softer seat.

Wild.
Jilted again, by Jupiter! Why, what a story did she trump up of 'the family complaint,' 'her old grandmother,' and 'her aunt, Ursula.' Wildlove, thou wert born to be a woman's dupe; but I'll pursue her, if 'twere a league beyond the Antipodes.

Jer.
Pray, sir, don't start on such a long journey, while the weather's so warm. If one woman has fooled you now, you may have your revenge on another before night.

Wild.
True, true; I may, I will. Have you executed your commissions?

Jer.
To the very tittle; the bookcase stands prepared for us, according to direction, at the cabinet-maker's. so that we have only to slip into it at our own convenience. Meanwhile, the people of the hotel have given out among their neighbours that a party of pleasure takes you out of town for the evening, and that your lodgings remain vacant till to-morrow; therefore, sir, if the enemy fishes for intelligence of our motions, as we guess she does, the trick must take, and to-night infallibly we catch her in the springe.

Wild.
Excellent, Jeremy! I'm eager for the moment. Oh! if I can but bring one of my plagues to a reckoning, she shall answer for all the misdemeanors of her sex -- past, present, and to come.

Jer.
I hope she may prove a strong woman, since to carry such a load, might break the back of a camel.

Wild.
Allons! you rogue.

Women, when resolutely cours'd, like game, 
The sportsman's mettle by delays inflame. 
They double -- turn and double -- turn again -- 
Their flight but cheers us, since they fly in vain 
 [Exeunt, L. 

SCENE II.

 -- Chamber at Signor Rafael's.

Enter Zephyrina , L. , hastily, meeting Negombo , R.

Zeph.
Oh! Negombo, I'm so out of breath -- so frightened -- and so fluttered.

Neg.
Poor dear lady! what make you flutter?

Zeph.
The old original mischief-maker -- a man. Oh! such a run have I had to escape his clutches -- but I'm safe at last. Where's my uncle?

Neg.
Old massa lay him head down; take nappy, nappy.

Zeph.
Well, and have you gleaned any news from next door?

Neg.
Yes, my lady, great deal news; such you like to hear. Englishman gone away for all night; him room locked up -- nobody stay at home.

Zeph.
That's fortunate. Then I may venture to skirmish beyond the barrier once again: though, faith, I was nigh paying dearly for my last excursion. Negombo, peep into my uncle's closet; and, if you find the old gentleman stirring yet, summon him forthwith as president of my privy council. [Exit Negombo, R. This saucy son of St. George! with his 'Hearts of Oak,' his 'Britons never will be Slaves,' and the rest of his impudent watchwords! Marry, hang the fellow, for being so agreeable in his obstinacy! No; I won't resign him so easily. One more daring decisive effort; and if that fails, I'll break my looking-glass, scandalize my neighbours, and nurse parrots and monkies for the rest of my days.

Re-enter Negombo , R.

Neg.
Lady, old massa not wake yet; but me see great case just now carry in next door -- so heavy -- man tell all fill wid great book.

Zeph.
Was it directed to Wildlove?

Neg.
Yes, lady. He wise man read so much book.

Zeph.
And have they carried it to his chamber?

Neg.
Yes, but door locked again; all gone.

Zeph.
I think it likely my captain may have left another letter for me on his table. Now, then, is a safe moment to seek for it; but, as evening will overtake us presently, run you, Negombo, to my dressing-room, and prepare the dark lantern against my enterprize. [Exit Negombo, R. Yes, the fellow is so impudent, so wicked, and so difficult to catch, that positively I must have him. 'Tis a wild animal to make a husband of. Ah! only let me bring him to that pass, and I think I should find a way to tame him.

 [Exit, R. 

SCENE III.

 -- Wildlove's Chamber: it is dark. A large upright Bookcase stands facing the Audience: it has folding doors. A Table, with pens, ink, paper, and books; two candles, not lighted.

One door of the bookcase is slowly opened, and Wildlove peeps out.

Wild.
Hist! Jeremy!

The other door is opened and Jeremy appears.

Jer. [Answering.] 
Hist! master!

Wild.
Do you hear anything?

Jer.
No; do you?

Wild.
My limbs ache already in these narrow quarters.

Jer.
I shall die of the cramp, if I'm boxed up much longer.

Wild.
Pshaw! we'll watch another hour at any rate. Hark! don't you hear something now?

Jer.
It's a scratching in the wall.

Wild.
Hush! hold your breath: whisper in a lower key.

Enter Zephyrina , cautiously, through the secret door, L. , which she closes, and pauses to listen before she advances; she carries a dark lantern, which is shut.

Zeph.
All's hushed; after my late surprise, however, I had best be cautious.

 [She steals forward, step by step, advancing her hand before her, to feel the way. 

Wild.
Something seems to move within the room.

Jer.
I heard a board creak behind us.

Wild.
Again! Hush!

Zeph. [Pausing in the centre of the apartment.] 
I fancy everything is safe, so I may venture to illumine. 
[Turns her lantern outwards. 

Jer. [In a tremulous whisper.] 
Look yonder; a blue fire! Oh! it's the devil! -- the devil!

Wild.
Silence! or I'll send you to him.

Jer.
I can't be silent; my teeth chatter in my head in spite of me.

Zeph. [Moving the lantern about on either side of her.] 
Let me take a regular survey in the first instance. 
[Goes towards the bookcase; Wildlove and Jeremy draw to the doors as the light approaches.]
What have we here? the new bookcase! a goodly piece of furniture! Now for the door; lest an ambush be planted in the anteroom, I'll make free to draw the inside bolt. 
[Bolts the door.]
There; now I'm secured against all hazards, and can amuse myself at leisure. 
[She recrosses the apartment towards the table, and passes the lantern over its surface.]
I don't spy the billet-doux I had expected to find. 
[Moves the table forward.]
A little more light will be useful.

 [She lights the two candles which stand on the table; while so employed, the bookcase again opens, and Wildlove and Jeremy look out. 

Wild.
It's a woman! a real woman!

Jer.
Don't be too sure of that, sir; yet, now I look again, it's the very cockatrice who blinded me this morning.

Wild.
I wish I could see her face! Look! she takes a seat. [Zephyrina sits at the side of the table. What's she going to do now?

Jer.
Some damnable conjuration. Oh, lord! we shall all pass through the ceiling presently in a whirlwind.

Zeph. [Her face still averted from the bookcase.] 
Well, since the gentleman won't write, I will. This shall be my last effort; in this I must either conquer or -- no, I won't die.

 [Begins to write. 

Wild. [Stealing forward.] 
We shall secure her now. 
[To Jeremy.]
Pass round upon the other side of the table.

Jer.
Sir, remember snuff.

Wild.
Whisht! tread softly.

 [They advance step by step as she continues to write. 

Zeph.
Yes, the style must be spirited and laconic. Let me think -- the next sentence must -- yes, that will run exceedingly well; and now -- 

Wild.
You are my prisoner, madam.

 [Passing his arm to clasp her. 

Zeph.
Ah!

 [Dropping her pen, she has just time to draw her veil forward before Wildlove bends, to look in her face. 

Jer. [On the opposite side of the table.] 
Hold her fast, master! hold her fast!

Wild.
Now, madam, in the devil's name, who and what are you? [Zephyrina motions as if she were about to speak, then sinks back in the chair, as if overwhelmed. The pretty innocent! quite confounded! dumb through excessive modesty! This cloak won't serve you, my dear; think of your offences.

Jer.
Aye! think of my eyes -- there was an atrocity.

Wild.
Speak quickly, my dear; or I shall make free to lift that veil, and -- [Zephyrina, starting up, points to Jeremy, and seems to petition that she may speak to Wildlove in private. Oh, ho! you wish to be left with me in private? Umph! I thought it would come to that at last. You shall be indulged, my dear. Jeremy, take one of the candles, and wait in the anteroom.

Jer.
Don't trust her, sir; she'll slip through your fingers in a twinkling.

Wild.
If she does, I'll forgive her everything.

Jer.
Have a care, sir; suppose she raises the devil.

Wild.
That's very likely; but leave us.

Jer. [Unbolting the door.] 
Nay, master, only remember the proverb, 'Wilful man -- 

Wild. [Stamping.] 
Rascal!

Jer.
Oh! I'm gone.

 [Exit Jeremy, at door, R. 

Wild. [Leading Zephyrina forward.] 
Now, my pretty prisoner, now no eye can see, no ear can listen -- now let me fold my arms around you, and -- 

Zeph.
Hold! be generous as you are brave.

Wild.
That voice! I guessed aright! Hurra! it is -- it is -- 

Zeph.
Yes, captain, 'tis even so; your gipsy of the masquerade and the fairy of this chamber stand before you in the same person.

Wild.
Ravishing confession! Thou dear concentrated essence of all that's mischievous in woman, have I caught thee in my power at last?

Zeph.
'Caught,' too fatally I am; but, oh! captain, act nobly -- open the net, and let the bird fly again. [Negombo shows herself at the secret door; Wildlove attempts to lift Zephyrina's veil. For heaven's sake, remember I'm a woman of honour.

Wild.
And, remember I'm a man of honour. So, no more idle coyness, but -- 

Zeph. [Struggling.] 
Wildlove, I conjure you, act not with inhumanity to a woman, whose unbounded love for you has caused her only indiscretion.

Wild. [Aside.] 
Her 'unbounded love' -- poor girl! there's something touching in that. Why, look ye, my dear, that I should suffer you to escape me is out of the question; but I may grant a short parley, upon condition that you confess ingenuously, and upon the instant, who you are, whence you come, and how you got into this lodging.

 [Here Zephyrina sees Negombo at the secret door, makes a rapid sign, and appears to catch an idea. Negombo disappears. 

Zeph.
I accept your terms -- I will confess everything; but oh! I shall sink with confusion if you look at me -- shame chokes my utterance. Pray, captain, turn your face from me while I repeat my follies.

Wild.
No, no; I don't trust you out of sight. I haven't forgot your grandmother and your aunt Ursula.

Zeph.
Nay, then, hold me -- 
[Giving one end of her veil into his hand]
 -- but, if you look at me, I positively never can confess.

Wild. [Aside.] 
Poor creature! her passion for me no doubt overcomes her. Well, there; I'm not looking at you now; begin.

Zeph.
Ah! but should you turn your head -- 

Wild.
Pshaw! make thy confession honestly, and I won't turn till it is finished.

Zeph.
Must I tell everything?

Wild.
I'll not abate you one particular.

Zeph.
The entire process of my passion for you?

Wild.
From beginning to end.

Zeph.
You promise faithfully?

Wild. [Impatiently.] 
I do -- I do.

Zeph.
Heigho! Listen, then, and pity the errors of a too susceptible and suffering heart.

 [Wildlove stands with his back to Zephyrina; but holding the end of her veil, which is sufficiently long to fall to her feet upon either side. He pulls it occasionally, to satisfy himself she is not slipping from him. 

AIR -- Zephyrina .

When first we met, your shape -- your air -- 
My eyes pronounc'd beyond compare. 
But when, unmask'd, I saw your face! 
My feelings then what words may trace? 
Ah! why did nature form you so? 
Heigho! Signor -- Signor, heigho! 

Wild. [Aside.] 
Dear, sensitive girl! I pity her upon my soul. Proceed, my angel! don't be ashamed to confess your sensations -- they were not be avoided. Proceed, I beseech you; I feel for you most acutely. Proceed!

Enter Negombo from the secret door, L. ; she steals towards Zephyrina, who has beckoned to her, as she begins the second verse.

AIR -- (Continued) -- Zephyrina.

Those eyes, like heav'nly stars that shine; 
The brows, which neither meet nor join; 
Those clust'ring locks, of nut-brown shade; 
Those lips, which move but to persuade! 
Oh! why did nature form you so? 
Heigho! Signor -- Signor, heigho! 
 [At the end of each line of the foregoing stanza, Wildlove, chuckling with self-satisfaction, bowsi and interrupts her praises with 'Oh! you flatter' -- 'Really, you are too kind' -- 'I don't deserve it,' &c. Meanwhile Zephyrina directs Negombo by signals, and, lifting the veil gradually from off her own figure, contrives to let it fall over Negombo, whom she places exactly in her stead. 

Wild.
Upon my soul, I never can express myself sufficiently; but you shan't find me cruel; so proceed, my angel, I beseech you. Nay, proceed!

[ Zephyrina sings in a very subdued key, as if she were weeping, while she gives the last arrangement to the veil.

Ah! why did nature form you so? 
Heigho! Signor -- Signor, heigho! 

Wild. [Aside.] 
Poor creature! agitated even to tears. Go on; believe me, I'm all tenderness -- all sympathy -- [Zephyrina, drawing back upon tiptoe, effects her escape unheard, having first drawn off the white gloves from her arms, and given them to Negombo, who puts them on. 

[After a short pause]
 -- Nay, my dear, these scruples are quite fastidious. Well, my figure and face, then, had the good fortune to please you; for so much of your information, I'm all gratitude. But now to yourself. Come, come, be explicit. Silent still! eh! -- 
[He pulls the veil; Negombo affects to sob]
 -- crying still! positively this is ungenerous in you. Remember, unless you proceed with your confession, our contract is at an end. I shall turn my head; upon my soul. I shall. 
[Negombo sobs louder.]
Oh! 'tisn't in man to withhold any longer. My love! my angel! speak your sorrows! -- [He turns round, flings himself upon his knee, and catches Negombo's hand, which is completely covered by the glove. She at the same time averts her face, and with her disengaged hand draws the veil closely round her figure. Thus upon this dear, soft hand, I print a thousand kisses, and thus, upon my knee -- 

Enter Claudian , hastily, from the anteroom, R. , Jeremy following.

Clau.
Nay, by all the gods, I'll have a peep. Joy! joy! Wildlove -- a thousand joys! How! upon your knees?

Wild.
Aye, upon my knees in adoration! Here she stands -- the loveliest -- most bewitching -- most celestial -- 

 [Devouring her hand with kisses. 

Jer.
Lord! how he swears!

Wild.
Thus let me draw you to my panting heart! -- 
[Draws Negombo down upon his knee]
 -- and thus, with gentle violence, implore you to reveal and bless me with your charms!

 [Negombo suddenly flings back the veil, and their faces come in contact. Wildlove fixes his eye in amazement, and appears spell-bound to his posture. 

Jer. [Roaring out] 
Oh lord! oh lord! it's the black gentleman in petticoats, after all! My master's making love to the devil!

Neg.
Massa, me yield -- me make you blest.

 [She throws her arms about his neck. 

Wild.
Ah! -- Claudian! -- Jeremy! pull me from her! save me from suffocation. 
[He extricates himself and stands supported by Claudian and Jeremy.]
Carry me to a cold bath, or an ice-house, quickly -- it's my only remedy; for I'm all a dissolution!

Clau. [Gazing in astonishment.] 
Why, this is Negombo, the servant of -- 

 [Negombo puts her finger to her lip, and Claudian stops. 

Wild.
If thou hast any intelligence with that handmaid of darkness, conjure her, as thou valuest the tenement of thy friend's wits, to solve these riddles instantly. Bid her declare the spirit, evil or blest, who haunts me.

Clau.
Alas! Wildlove, if my conjecture be right, that spirit may only be summoned by a spell which you will hardly have the courage to utter.

Wild.
Try me.

Clau.
Then muster up all your fortitude, and call upon Hymen.

Wild.
That's a choker! Ugh! ugh! it sticks in a bachelor's throat -- but curiosity and desperation force it down. Well, then, in the name of Hymen, I invoke the spirit!

Zeph. [Discovering herself at the secret door.] 
On that enforcement she appears at once.

Wild. [Starting.] 
Ha! the walls themselves expand! 'Tis she! 'tis she!

Enter Signor Rafael at the secret door, L. , and leads Zephyrina forward.

Raf.
Captain Wildlove, allow me to introduce to you, for the second time, my niece, the Signora Zephyrina.

Wild.
How, sir! my incognita -- my fairy! This your niece -- this -- this?

Zeph. [Curtseying archly.] 
Yes, sir; this is the 'automaton;' -- 'the woman in whose face you looked but once, and then were so scared, you durst not take a second peep.' Pray, sir, how do you like me now?

Wild. [Aside.] 
She has me every way. My doom is settled.

Zeph. [Affecting a demure look and tone.] 
So is mine. I'm come to ask forgiveness of all my naughty tricks, and end my days in a nunnery.

Wild.
You may take the vows as soon as you please, but they must be made in my company.

Zeph.
Oh fie! don't squeeze my hand. Well, most votes shall carry it -- a captain or a nunnery? that's the question. You who are for the captain, hold up your hands. 
[They all hold up.]
Oh! it's carried nem. con. ; they're all for the captain.

 [Gives her hand to Wildlove. 

Wild.
And will you take the word of command from me in future?

Zeph.
Yea; two-thirds of it, upon fair conditions -- that is, so long as you remember to love, I never shall forget to honour and obey.

FINALE.

Zeph. 

A score of idle things I've said, 
A hundred more committed; 
Yet, since with friends' consent I wed, 
Here let me stand acquitted. 

Ye critics stern, from wedlock's pale 
Avert all storms of evil; 
Oh! let a Lady's suit prevail, 
And pray don't play the Devil! 

Chorus. 
 Ye critics stern, &c. 

Wild. 
From Freedom's range to Hymen's sway, 
I bend with hesitation; 
One only trust can doubts allay -- 
Friends' gen'ral approbation. 

Jer. 
If settlements by you are marr'd, 
Poor servants lose their places. 

Neg. 
Save negro maid from doom so hard, 
Nor mock her with black faces! 

Chorus. 
 Ye critics stern, &c. 

Back matter

THE END.
