SCENE I.

-- Melford's Lodgings. Table and chairs -- newspaper on the table. Melford discovered reading newspaper.

Mel.
"To let" -- "To let," -- "Lost," -- and "Wanted." How very edifying these advertisements are! "Strayed!" -- "Rowland's Macassar," -- Ditto "Kalydor," -- and a "Fine bear to be shot!" Heyday, what's this? "Furnished lodgings, apply at Mrs. Warnmore's," why, that's my Maria's aunt, and -- egad! a capital thought, the old lady has never seen me, though she forbids our union. I have only to take an assumed name, offer myself as a lodger, and off I can fly with Maria forthwith. Capital! capital! how I doat on advertisements. 
Enter Lucius Lily .

Heyday! who can this be! a black man! A bad omen -- forbodes a shade to my happiness. Who are you, friend?

Luc.
Read dat letter, Massa, dat tell you my character.

Mel.
Ah, it cannot blacken his reputation. Oh, I see, you are come to be my servant in place of the rascal I am going to turn away.

Luc.
Iss, massa! -- me capital fellow to fill rascal's place.

Mel.
Why your character seems pretty good.

Luc.
White as him driven snow.

Mel. (Aside.) 
Egad: snow must have driven a long way before it resembled him. What's your name?

Luc.
Lucius Lily.

Mel.
A pretty fleur-de-lis. You've been in service before?

Luc.
Massa, me been ebery ting -- me serve at de bottom of Highgate hill, and den dey call me Lily ob de valley -- me turn waterman -- jolly young waterman -- and den dey call me water Lily; me turn itinerant fish-monger -- and den de naughty boys, call me Lily white muscle. Me been ebery ting you can tink ob.

Mel.
Quite a sable Crichton -- sober, I hope.

Luc.
Massa, me neber touch a drop ob noting 'sept to keep de cold out; me often catch cold, massa, -- me blong to de Temperance society -- when me swear to take noting strong. Swear till me black in de face.

Mel.
And you never seem to have recovered from the effects of the oath. Well, Lucius, you may stop.

Luc.
Tank'ye massa.

Toby. (Without) 
"We won't go home till morning," 
Enter Toby Quondam L. half tipsy.

"We won't go home till" -- my master at home? 
(Hiccup.) 
You did not want me, I hope, sir?

Mel.
Oh, no! -- not in the least -- I don't want you any more. There's the door, my fine fellow.

Toby. (Hiccup.) 
Of course it is -- that's the door -- it an't the window -- no! Do you think I don't know the door from the window? -- do you think I'm drunk?

Mel.
Drunk or sober, I give you warning on the spot -- Lucius, see that the rascal goes immediately -- I leave him in your hands.

[Exit Melford . 

Toby.
And a pair of d -- d black hands you leave me in too.

Luc.
You bad man, massa -- you no do, what me do -- you no leave off gin- water .

Toby. (Hiccup.) 
Yes, I do -- gin and water:

(Sings.) 

"Never mix your liquor, boys, but always drink it neat." 
With a chip-chow, &c. 

Luc.
What awful low song! -- Him no dignity ob soul -- me shame ob my predecessor, as de boy say when him fader hang'd.

Toby.
Come along my buck; I'm a liberal soul, and I feel for you -- you black spot on the face of the creation 
(Hiccup.)
-- you shady part of a picture! Come with me and we'll have a glass.

Luc.
No tankee massa -- me rader not -- me not like you company, if me play wid pitch me black my finger.

Toby.
Don't be insolent, thou animated tea-pot.

Luc.
Dam!

Toby.
Don't wax warm -- stick of black sealing wax.

Luc.
Sealing wax! Me sealing wax! -- do you call me dat? -- me take care you make no impression on me.

Toby. (Hiccup.) 
Hold your tongue in the presence of superiors, you're an inferior order, 
(Hiccup.)
you nigger.

Luc.
No such ting! we men ob colour, de beauties ob de unibersal uniberse, we be de black spot on de domino -- de white man be de white ob de domino, only put to show de black off to more advantage.

Toby.
Zounds, he's as bright as Warren's Blacking, but I can fathom you -- though you're as deep as the sea, 
(Hiccup.)
-- as the black sea! you are a rival -- I know you -- you are trying to cut me out with Mary Magnet. Black treachery!

Luc.
Cut you out, dat no difficult matter, me tink.

Toby.
I say, sir, as a gentleman, I never was cut out.

Luc.
True, me tink you nebber was cut out as a gentleman in your life.

Toby.
Well, I'm going to leave -- you facetious nigger -- you cutting rascal -- you black diamond -- only let me give you 
(Hiccup.)
a friendly hint. I have already possession of Mary's heart 
(Hiccup.)
-- it's mine -- as Thingummy says in his book of chess. White has made the first move

[Exit Toby . L 

Luc.
Ah, but dat same Mr. Thingummy say in him next page, Black win him game; and after, all, who not say de nigger better nor de buckra man? when me piccanini-boy, my gubberness what was a nigger, say dat natur make fuss de white man, den dey look so dam ugly, she painted 'em black.

SONG.

Moder natur make a world, 
'Tis a berry long time back; 
First she make a buckra man, 
After dat, she paint him black. 

At a white man, how she look! 
Tink him cut a sorry figure, 
So she get a painting-brush, 
Paint him to a handsome nigger. 

She'd have painted all so fine, 
Made deir skin look quite delightful; 
Only some behave dam bad, 
Fight, and swear, and cuss, oh, frightful. 
Moder natur woud not stop, 
Flew away, like shot from trigger, 
Left the wicked man so white, 
Ebbery good man was a nigger. 
[Exit. L 

SCENE II.

-- An apartment in Mrs. Warnmore's residence -- in c. a window -- folded screen leaning against wall -- cupboards, R. and L. , likewise a cupboard in the two opposite wings, towards L. a dressed wax figure, large as life, of 'Pity poor African'. Tables and chairs -- letters on table. Mrs. Warnmore and Maria discovered.

Mrs. W.
Another rout this evening, Maria, what delightful times are these.

Maria.
Nay, my dear aunt -- I'm almost tired of such a round of gaieties.

Mrs. W.
Nonsense; -- though I must confess, that when we do not let our first floor, we are a little straitened -- but no matter for that, here are letters from a Mr. Tomlinson -- a Mr. Doddington, all in answer to my advertisement.

Enter Boy , L followed by Porter, carrying tin vessel, and a written note.

Boy.
This way, this way.

Porter.
A note, Ma'am. 
(Giving it.) 

Mrs. W. (Opening note, and reads.) 
-- "Dear Aunt, please keep this vessel of gas till I come, which will be to-morrow, take care no light approaches it, or your house may be blown up.
Your affectionate nephew, Nathaniel Nitrogen ."
Mighty pleasant, that because one's nephews study chemistry, one must run the risk of having one's house about one's ears -- put it in that cupboard.

(Points R. ) 

(Porter places it in cupboard, R. ) 

Boy,
And please here's the new servant come.

[Exit Boy , and Porter L 

Enter Mary Magnet . L.

Mrs. W.
Good evening my good girl, your name, I believe is Mary?

Mary.
Mary Magnet, mum; born at Sudbury, mum; daughter of Timothy Magnet, and Sukey his wife, mum; com'd up to London when fourteen and-a-half, as you will see on the blank leaf of my spelling-book.

Mrs. W:
Yes -- yes -- now Mary, you are aware that there will be no fellow-servants, but that little boy.

Maria. (Aside.) 
And yet with a first floor to let, and a single maid-servant, to ape all the style of the rich. I shall go and dress, aunt -- oh vanity! vanity.

(Aside.) 

Exit Maria . R. 

Mrs. W.
You are aware, I say, you will have no fellow-servants.

Mary.
Glad on it, mum, 'ticklar glad, never cou'd abide company -- love's solitariness! -- when a good little girl with a blue pinafore, and black socks on -- I used not to go for to play with the other children, but used to sit on father's stepping with my finger in my hinnocent little mouth.

Mrs. W.
Very good, very good indeed, -- and now, Mary, there is one thing I must insist on -- No followers!

Mary.
Followers, mum? b'lieve not indeed -- never had no followers, sept a hunkle, and he died six years ago, and left father a chest of drawers, and a japan tea-caddy.

Mrs. W.
No cousins, I hope?

Mary.
Lawk no, poor dear hunkle what's dead, never led nobody to the hymeneal haltar.

Mrs. W.
No brothers or sisters?

Mary
No mum, father only had one on us -- but that is you'll see was a good un.

Mrs. W.
Very well, time will shew that -- my neice and I, Mary, are now going to a party, we may not be home till late, you may, if you like, sit here and read the Pilgrims' Progress, only mind -- No followers! and oh, I had forgot, take particular care of that black image. The ladies nigger association take tea at Exeter Hall, to-morrow evening, and that sable gentleman will preside over the tea-pot, and be sure you on no account open that cupboard.

[Exit Mrs. Warnmore L. 

Mary.
No followers! I likes that. How unnatral; what's to become of hall one's hants and hunkles, town and country cousins, if they don't dine every Sunday at one's Missuss's expence. Wot's sweethearts to do? and what's a woman without a sweetheart? Thank goodness I got two, a black un and a white un, pleasing contrast. So I'm to sit here with that great hartificial nigger for company, I'll read the heart pourings of my swains arts in their two wallentines. Here's the white 'un's, a little boy a flying about with a postman's jacket on, and wings upon his little shoulders. Here's the black 'un's, a great art, painted red.

"White cherry and red may be a treat, 
But black cherry be more sweet." 
Wot a delicate hallusion. 
Enter Boy. L.

My little man. You don't tell tales, do you? 

Boy. 
I should think not. 

Mary.
I mean, if -- he! he! he! I should have a friend come, an old lady or so, or -- or -- or a young gentleman, you, you could keep your tongue between your teeth?

Boy.
I believe you, don't Joe the baker, and Bill the pot-boy come to play at knuckle down with me in the pantry when Misses is out, and don't hant call that I may give her the dripping.

(Door bell rings.) 

Mary.
Run, run, as fast as your legs can carry you, [Exit Boy L. ] A youth that of talent and integrity, if he was a little bigger he might serve for company. 
Enter Toby. L.

Lawk-a-daisy, it's well missus is out; keep away you naughty man, I an't allowed no followers.

Toby.
No followers; then they ought to dim the lustre of those bright little eyes, obliterate the dimples of those cheeks, erase the smile from those lips, for where there are so many charms -- damme, followers come as a thing of course,

Mary. (Aside.) 
How figurative he talks, a preposessing creature, now Toby, go away. You know I hates so much on it, he! he! he! I say as Clementina did to Antonio in the story book, "Be hoff!"

Toby.
You mean I'm to allez vouz en, as the French say, I understand! I'm awake. To make way for a certain dark looking gentlemen, the devil!

Mary. (Aside.) 
Oh, gemini! he's been a finding out Lily's little attentions. Now Mr. Toby.

Toby.
Oh yes, Miss Magnet, I'm to go. I'm inconscient! The white man is to give place to the black, as day does to night, or snow does to mud -- I leave you.

Mary.
Now, Mr. Toby, dont go: you know when I said be hoff, it was only my insinnivating way of speaking, it was a little metaphor.

Toby.
Oh! I'm superfluous! white is out of fashion, to be blown off like the head of a pot of porter, to leave the black behind. There, there's an artificial nigger, look at him, and think of Mr. Lucius.

Mary.
Nay, nay, you men are such hasty things when you takes a thing into your heads, there an't no talking at all. Now look'ye Toby, I won't have no more to say on the gentleman of colour, Mr, Toby.

Toby.
But, you'll cut him dead?

Mary. (Aside.) 
Yes, quite dead, for I'm sure he'll break his art.

Toby.
Come to my arms. Damme, now I care for no one; nay, if your missus comes, I'll look at her boldly in the face and say 
(Door bell rings.)
Who the devil's that! can't I bolt up the chimney?

Enter Boy. L

Boy.
Nigger gentleman as wants to see Mary Magnet.

[Exit Boy. L 

Enter Lucius. L.

Toby.
Treachery! it's written in black and white.

Mary.
Mr. Lucius; no followers, are allowed.

Luc.
Allowed! dam allowed; more danger, more glory, dat buckra man, him on de free list. How you do, massa!

Toby.
Ugh! ask no questions, and you'll be -- 

Mary.
Now gentlemen, gentlemen, don't quarrel! Heigho! I'm a hunworthy cretur to fight about, besides I'm so tender-arted, if one on you get a black eye, I should never forgive -- 

Luc.
Me obey you, me can be terrible as boa constrictor, gentle as a sheep.

Toby.
Ugh! a black sheep.

Luc.
Gib me your hand, massa.

Toby.
Not I; I won't speak to you. 
(Door bell rings.)
My dear fellow, where the deuce shall we hide ourselves?

Mary.
Deary me! deary me! what a twitter that 'ere bell sets me in, the clapper in it knocked against my poor nerves.

Enter Boy. L.

Boy.
Mr. and Mrs. Dodds, and the three Miss Dodd's all wants Mary Magnet.

[Exit Boy. L. 

Mary.
And no followers allowed! Oh, what wou'd Missus say if she know'd it; well, Dodds promised to leave me his big table, and hant her silver thimble, one can't turn 'em out.

Enter Mr. and Mrs. Dodds , and three daughters. L.

Mr. Dodds.
Ah, Mary, my pretty, got a place I see, come to congratulate you.

Mary.
Thankye, thankye, 
(Aside.)
shan't keep it long I'm thinking; how do aunt? how do Kitty? how do Betsy? how do Caroline? How does Sammywell? you blushes, you see I knows all about it. Mr. Quondam, Uncle Dodds, Mr. Lucius.

(At sight of Lucius women all scream.) 

Mrs. D.
Oh, Mary where did you pick up that horrid black man?

Lucius. (Aside.) 
He! he! he! me make impression, dat always de way wid de women when dey look at me; me wonder what make me so dam fascinating?

Toby.
Glad to see you, ladies, you some of you preserve your natural taste, you an't perverted!

Lucius.
What debbel you mean?

Toby.
Why, don't you see you're superfluous; the ladies don't like you -- now, if you had manners you'd be scarce.

Mary.
There they goes agin! Now gentlemen, gentlemen, it's -- he! he! he! a little bit of jealousy -- ha! ha! ha!

Dodd's
He! he! he! Oh, la, well I'm sure, &c.

Toby.
Why don't you go, your company is not required.

Luc.
My company may not be, as you yourself is part of it: dam bad company, but my own self.

Toby.
There's an artificial nigger, quite enough at a time, We're satisfied with the imitation and don't want the real article.

Mary.
Now, gentlemen, don't be personable, don't be personable, it is so orrid vulgar: you are both very well in your way, both as natur made you; both, well in your way.

Toby.
Damn'd if he's well in my way. Leave us, sir, save us, change your course, or you'll meet with your deserts

Luc.
Him treaten! Him dam! Me black your eye.

Toby.
Don't doubt it, if you hit, 'cas the color will some off. -- 

A scuffle, women scream, at length, Lucius is knocked against the Negro Image, which falls and breaks.) 

Mary.
Oh, gemini! oh, dear! that 'ere nigger has lost his place, and I shall lose mine, missuss's head will be turned, when she sees that fellow's head twisted -- ha, she'll look as black as himself. Head here! Arms there! and legs no-where! Oh, gemini! gemini!

Dodds.
Oh, la! what a pity! only think, &c.

Luc.
It's dat dam fellow, as made me spill dis beautiful pictur ob humanity, if it was image of de white trash me no care, but him a nigger, him sympathies is roused.

Toby.
Oh, there's a bit of practical anatomy -- Ha! ha! ha! I'm very sorry, upon my soul, I am, Polly! Ha! ha! ha! and did not mean it, if that chap had stood firm on his legs, it wouldn't have happened. There's an omen for you, Mr. Lily, your downfall is foretold.

Mary. (Putting screen before pedestal.) 
There, there, oh, dear! that will do for the present, that will hide the wrack till to-morrow, there, there. 
(A double knock and ring.)
Oh, there's missus, oh, oh!

Enter Boy, L.

Boy.
Oh, Mary, sich a go, missus is on the stairs.

[Exit Boy, L 

Mary.
Oh, I shall faint, vanish, you, you Dodds's, and Toby's, and Lucius's, what do you teaze one so for what are you so intrusin for?

Dodds.
Well I'm sure! What's the matter?

Mary.
Matter! I'm allowed no followers, and I shall lose my place, if missus catches you; there Kitty, there Betsy, there. -- 
(Forcing the two Miss Dodds in closet L. Mrs. Dodds in closet R. Old Dodds in closet R. C. Lucius in closet L. C. All struggling and exclaiming "What in such a place as this, &c. &c." 

Dodds.
I say, this place is as dark as pitch.

Mary.
Well, here's a candle you old -- dear uncle, I mean, here.

(Gives him a candle.) 

Luc. (From cupboard.) 
Dis nassy place no suit me.

Toby.
Where the devil am I to go? I'm a residue! substract every body from the company, and there remains one -- a cursedly unlucky one.

Mary.
As you value my reputation, as you value my love, do go somewhere, dear Toby.

Toby.
That's soon said "somewhere!" Where is somewhere? hang'd if I can see any where! I can't evaporate.

Mary.
Toby, you arn't got no ingenuity, or you'd find a place, I discards you -- I bids you quit my sight.

Mary.
Would to heaven, I could, but that's no such easy matter.

Enter Mrs. Warnmore and Maria, L.

Mrs. W.
Well, we have left sooner than we intended No one, Mary, has been here?

Mary.
No marm, not a soul. 
(Aside.)
That's true enough, for my stupid friends arn't got no souls. No!

Maria. (Seeing Toby .) 
Why, aunt, here's a gentleman.

Toby.
No, no, oh, dear! I'm sure I an't.

Mrs. W.
Why, Mary, Mary, this is some one.

Mary.
Yes, mum, it is rather some one, yes.

Toby.
Yes, mum, as the young woman says, I'm rather some one, but if you please, I shall be very happy to be no one.

Maria.
A strange person.

Mrs. W.
Um -- odd -- No friend of yours, I hope, Mary.

Mary.
Dear no, marm.

Mrs. W.
Oh, probably the writer of one of these letters?

Toby.
Yes, mum, yes; that's the very thing. (Aside.)
I wrote them all if she likes.

Mrs. W. (Turning over letters.) 
Let me see, "Two months after date, I promise to pay fifteen pounds.

Mary.
Oh, that's it, I should not wonder.

Toby.
No, no, decidedly not! It was not that.

Mrs. W.
Oh, I see, you are come about my first floor!

Toby.
Yes, yes, that's what I came about, and -- 
(Aside.)
Wonder, I'm not floored before this.

Mary.
Oh, marm, he'll make a capital tenant, I sees the look on him. Very happy to wait on you, mum, happy to wait on you, make you comfortable, Tob, a-hem! sir!

Maria.

Mary.
Well, aunt, I shall retire till supper time.

[Exit Maria R. 

Mrs. W.
To my terms, sir, of course, you agree?

Mary.
Oh, of course, of course.

Toby.
Yes, yes, of course, of course.

Won't there be a flitting before next quarter day.

Mrs. W.
The ten pounds down at entrance.

Toby.
A-hem! That point, madam, requires -- 

Mary. (Aside,) 
Ten pounds! poor Toby! Madam, with respect to -- 

Mrs. W.
Silence! Well, I'm sure, young woman, go and get the supper things.

Mary.
Yes, mum. 
(Aside.)
The poor dear feller, I've trusted him with my heart, and its a hard matter if the old ooman can't trust him with her filthy looker.

[Exit Mary L. 

Mr. W.
That the ten pounds, you see, is an important consideration.

Toby.
Yes, ma'am, a consideration that requires consideration. well, well, I agree, of course. I'll make the note out directly, ma'am. Could you oblige me with sixpence to send out for a stamp?

Mrs. W.
Why, sir, I mean not to offend you, but we ladies, who let out lodgings are liable to such impositions. Do you know, sometimes persons come under an assumed name?

Toby.
Bless my soul! what depravity! You don't say so?

Mrs. W.
Yes, but I do, therefore; the ten pounds must be paid down.

Toby.
I see, I see, or the applicant walks down stairs. She will have the ready, and -- egad, its a nice place- I should like to stay, Why, madam -- out it must come.

Mrs. W.
What, the money?

Toby. (Aside.) 
No, that has been out long ago. secret, madam; its bursting my heart, and, and, as said before, out it must come. Oh -- h -- h.

Mrs. W.
Bless me! what a sudden change, what can have happened?

Toby.
Ah -- h -- h!

Mrs. W.
Are you ill, Mr. Douglas?

Toby.
Desperately! incurably! mortally! I will tell you all. One day, madam, I passed under a balcony when, methought, I felt something cold dripping down my neck, I looked up and saw -- a flower pot!

Mrs. W.
Was that all?

Toby.
No! I would it were. Behind the flower pot stood, holding a jug of water, a lady, not a girl, understand me.

Mrs. W.
No, no.

Toby.
No little, paltry, giggling girl, that brought to mind bread and butter with pinafores. No, no, she was matured into a severer style of beauty.

Mrs. W.
Well, sir, this is all very fine, but what have I to do with it?

Toby.
You to do with it, madam! You! -- Everything! You are the leading article, you are the beginning of the tale, the catastrophe, the tale of the tub, the -- the -- in short, you were the lady that stood among the flower pots, like love among the roses.

Mrs. W.
Really, Mr. Douglas, this is so sudden.

Toby.
Sudden, madam! so was the apparition. First came the sprinkling, then I threw up my eyes, and then my heart popped out of them.

Mrs. W.
Oh, dear, oh, dear, Mr. Douglas!

Toby. (Kneels.) 
Madam, cast me down, if you please. I admit my own unworthiness, I'm even more unworthy than you take me for. 
(Aside.)
A devilish deal! Yet, madam, I envied those flowers, unhappy Douglas, says I, would she had chucked a jug over me!

(Kissing her hand.) 

Enter Mary, L.

Mary.
Oh, gemini, well I never, why there's Toby a kneeling, and kissing missus's hand! Oh, please, madam.

Mrs. W.
Well, young woman -- intruding creature.

Toby.
Well, young woman.

Mary.
Young ooman! call me young ooman! That I should live to be called young ooman, by one's swet heart! Its more than I can bear -- Oh! -- oh! -- oh! 
(Crying,) 

Mr. W.
Why, Mary, Mary, what's the matter?

Toby.
Mary, young woman, this is very ridiculous. 
(Draws her aside.)
You see, Mary, a-hem! I have other connections, yes, you'll find Lucius a very nice young man, though he is rather dark, very.

Mrs. W.
Mr. Douglas, whispering?

Toby.
Only administering a little comfort, madam. 
(Whispers to Mary .)
You see, Mary, the intercourse between us must cease. Madam, I understand how to soothe the afflicted. I have other prospects.

Mary.
Prospects! Oh! oh! oh! I never see such a prospect in my life -- oh, Toby.

Mrs. W.
Well, Mary, are you not going to bring us any supper?

Mary.
Oh, ma'am, I han't the heart to -- Oh! oh! the tray, marm. 
(Aside.)
The deuce take the tray. What, what shall I bring up?

Mrs. W.
The cold chicken, and the hashed heart.

Mary.
Hashed heart. 
(Aside, striking her bosom.)
I've got it already.

[Exit Mary, L. 

Mrs. W.
Well, Mr. Douglas, we can consider about the first-floor, at any rate you will stay to supper?

Toby.
Madam, I shall be enraptured. 
(Aside.)
A supper! oh, Toby, the golden age is returning.

Enter Boy, L.

Boy.
Please mum, a gentleman as wants to speak with you.

[Exit Boy L. 

Enter Melford .

Mel.
Well, here I am at last, and -- 
(Sees Toby .)
Hey, day! here's my discarded servant.

Toby. (Aside.) 
My cast-off master, oh, damn it, I shall be un-Douglased! The blood of the Douglases will run.

Mrs. W.
Why, Mr. Douglas, do you know this gentleman?

Toby.
Yes, no, slightly, that is -- Oh -- h -- h!

Mel.
My scheme is annihilated! 
(Whispers to Toby .)
Toby, here are a couple of sovereigns for you. 
(Giving them.) 

Toby.
Thank'ye, Sir, you are very kind.

Mel. (Aside.) 
One hint! don't disclose my name.

Toby. (Aside.) 
Its all right! Pays me not to tell his name. I was just wishing to cash up something handsome for him not to tell mine -- Ha! ha! ha! Madam, allow me to introduce to you, my particular friend, Mr. Fitz-Richardson!

Mrs. W.
Any friend, I'm sure, of Mr. Douglas, is certain to be welcome.

Mel.
Douglas! madam?

Toby.
Yes, Douglas, to be sure, Douglas. 
(Aside. How damn'd thick some people are. 
(Whispers.)
I'm Douglas!

Mel.
Why, Toby, what are you after?

Toby.
Never mind, what I'm after. I'm before you at any rate.

Enter Mary , with tray and supper.

Mary.
Oh, dear! there he is, the faithless monster! Oh -- h -- h! what sorrows we poor servants has to undergo, as we waits at table; to swallow our grief while other people swallows their suppers. To feel one's heart breaking, while other people is breaking their fasts, to cover the table, while one can hardly cover one's sorrow Ah -- h -- h!

Enter Maria, R.

Maria.
My dear Aunt -- Ah! 
(Seeing Melford ,dreams.) 

Mrs. W.

Toby.
Hey-day! what's the row?

Mel. (To Maria ,) 
Hush!

Toby. (Aside.) 
Oh, its a hush business, is it. I shall get a brace more shiners before I have done with it. -- 

During the remainder of the Scene, before they sit to supper, Melford and Maria are conversing at back.)

Mary.
Please, mum, where is the spoons?

Mrs. W.
In that cupboard, child. 
(Pointing L. closet.) 

Mary.
Oh -- h -- h! In that cupboard? 
(Aside.)
Oh, gemini! the Nigger's there. In that -- that 'ere cupboard?

Mrs. W.
Yes, yes, are you deaf?

Toby.
How I hate servants that can't hear when they have spoken to. 
(Aside.)
What a luxury it is to blow up little.

Mary. (Aside.) 
The wretch is mistaking himself for a gentleman; you don't want the spoons ticklar to-night, mum?

Mrs. W.
Of course, I do!

Toby.
Of course, the lady does. 
(Goes close to Mary .)
What a remarkably stupid young woman you are!

Mary.
There's perfidy! 
(Slaps his face unperceived by the others.) 

Maria.
Goodness, what was that noise?

Mel.
A very striking sound!

Toby.
Yes, and a very striking sensation, I wonder what the devil it was? 
(Aside.)
The little vixen!

Marg. (Who has opened the cupboard.) 
Oh, Lily, you must be transplanted.

Luc. (Whispers.) 
Dat be dam, me can't move wid all dat posse ob people.

Mary.
As you wallies my reputation, as you wallies what is more -- my place! To save that, I shoved you in here, to save that I pulls you hout again! I'll get you to the door, walk close behind me. 
(Walks forward, Lucius walking close behind her, she manages to conceal him from all but Toby. Mrs. Warnmore stands R. Toby, L. , so that while she addresses Mrs. Warnmore, Toby looks straight on Lucius .)
There, I shadows you.

Luc.
Iss! me hope dis be de last time you cast me in de shade.

Mary.
Please, mum, here's the spoons!

Toby. (Aside.) 
Yes, a devilish large spoon, I see. Lucky woman, always has a lover in the train.

Mrs. W.
Why, Mary, you seem uneasy, what's the matter?

Mel.
Aye, the young woman does look rather blue.

Mary.
No, sir, no, indeed! 
(Aside.)
Its somebody else, looks rather black. 
(Turns and whispers to Lucius )
Can't you find the door? The door is not locked, so you might have bolted.

Toby. (Whispers to Lucius .) 
Ah! you are a constant lover, stick close to your fair mistress.

Luc. (Whispers.) 
Hold your dam tongue, Massa Toby, dis no time to dulge in conbersation, dis only fit for solliquy.

Toby. (Whispers.) 
What the devil made you put yourself in such a situation, you Indian pickle; are you drunk?

Luc. (Whispers.) 
No massa, no, eh! 
(Looking at Table.)
dat no bad thought, me no drunk, but me go under de table.

(Drops, and crawls under table. 

Mrs. W.
Well, well, Mary, don't be all night; why don't you set the spoons out, can't you move?

Mary.
He, he, he, yes mum, of course, I can mo-ve there's nothing to hi-n-inder me -- I -- 
(Looks over her shoulder, Aside.)
He's gone! that's a relief! move, oh dear, yes mum, as fast as you please, what could I be thinking of?

(Sets down the spoons.) 

Toby. (Aside.) 
The little black has absorbed like a blot in blotting-paper.

Luc. (Aside, under table.) 
Dis quarter superior to oder, toder was not half a quarter. Dat massa Toby, look 'ticklar cosay, he better off nor me.

Mrs. W.
Now will you all be seated. Mr. Douglas opposite to me. 
(When all seated, Melford and Maria are at back. Mrs. W. (R.) Toby, (L.) Mary stands behind Toby . 

Mel.
Yes, Mr. Douglas; ha! ha! ha!

Luc.
Mr. Douglas, ha! ha! ha! -- dat droll.

Maria.
Dear me, what's that?

Mary.
Oh, miss -- it's the -- 
(Aside.)
One's sweetheart is so horridly facetious-It's nothing ticklar, miss.

Toby.
No, no, it's an echo -- you -- Mr. Fitz -- Fitz- Richards, -- He! he! he! he! -- echo said -- Ha! ha! ha!

Mary.
Them blacks is such stupid creturs, I wishes he'd keep his fun to himself.

Toby.
Now ma'am, you'll take a wing: 
(Puts wing on Mrs. W's plate.)
my dear -- my dear madam, a glass of wine. 
(During this, Lucius puts up hand, and takes wing of fowl from plate.) 

Mary.
"Dear madam!" I never heard such perfidy, and before my eyes, how indelicate -- oh-h-h 
(Sobbing.) 

Mrs. W.
What Mary, sobbing again, child,

Mary. (During her aside speeches, stoops, and whispers, Toby .) 
Yes, mum, yes my poor dear hunkle died this day six years, mum, 
(Aside.)
I'll be even with you, you villain -- I'll stop these goings on. Yes, mum, he was a kind soul, 
(Aside.)
Nasty ungrateful traitor, he died -- and -- and 
(Aside.)
so shall I, and won't I come like Margaret's ghost!

Toby. (Aside.) 
Whispering again, I wish she wouldn't be so confidential.

Mrs. W.
Why, where's the wing of the fowl?

Luc. (Under table.) 
He! he! he! him wing fly away, displace not berry comfortable, but 'ticlar conbenient.

Toby.
Wing! wing taken flight, ma'am! take a leg, and mind that don't walk off. 
(Lifts up cloth, and whispers Lucius .)
I say, you nigger, don't aspire above your station, you have nothing to do with the upper part of the table.

Maria.
Surely I heard something under the table.

Mel.
What can it be?

Mary.
That, nothing at all, mum -- nothing 
(Aside.)
That'ere stupid nigger, why can't he be quiet! Low me to look, mum, 
(Peeps under table, and whispers)
Keep quiet, or you'll ruin me.

Luc.
Berry well, me'll die if it will serve you.

Mary.
There's nothing under the table, mum, nothing, 
(Aside.)
what with losing one sweetheart, and not being able to get rid of t'other.

Mrs. W.
There's a horrid draught in this part of the room, makes it quite cold.

Toby.
Don't feel it, marm -- don't feel it -- the warmth occasioned by my ardour produces -- produces -- 

Mary. (Aside.) 
There, he's going it again, he will go on saying soft things to missus. 
(Pinches Toby's ear.) 

Toby.
Oh! oh! oh!

Mrs. W.
Why Mr. Douglas, what can be the matter?

Toby.
It's -- oh! -- it's an ear-wig, 
(Whispers Mary .)
I say, what the devil was that for?

Mary. (Aside.) 
Why, you know as how I promised you my hand, so I gives you my thumb and finger as a hansel.

Mrs. W.
But really it is awfully cold, there must be a draught here; Mary, move the table.

Mary.
Move the table, mum? move the -- 
(Aside.)
oh dear, that will be a very bad move; better not, mum, table looks best here, mum, hides a black spot on the carpet.

Mrs. W.
Young woman, I want your obedience, not your opinion.

Toby.
Yes, young woman, highly improper for servants to answer! These common people grow so impertinent.

Mary.
They do indeed! and if you know'd all, mum, you'd say so. 
(Aside.)
Hupstart mushroom! He shall be a mushroom in a pickle before long.

Mrs. W.
Well, why not move the table?

Lucius crawls on all fours from beneath the table, behind screen.

Luc.
Dat notice to quit, me leave dis festive board, where board and lodging is all one, him can't fly widout him crawl. 
(Behind Screen.)
Him play all four, stoop low, him get game, while dat high Jack, lose de heart ob miss Mary.

Mary.
Oh, then I'm to move the table further back There, mum, there. 
(As she pushes the table, all rise, and sit down again. Aside.)
Why, he arn't there! singular!

Luc. (Peeping over Screen.) 
Ah, my lubey miss, you miss me, see how me hide my lustre for your sake, like shandileer in brown holland.

Toby. (Perceiving him.) 
Ah, he's not gone. Egad, my sable rival has got an active situation.

Luc. (Aside.) 
Fortune unjuss! There massa and missee Dodds in a cupboard, shove me in eberry hole and corner, while dat nassy white face sit at de table and joy himself. We was all in one boat, but massa Toby got the best cabin.

Maria.
Really aunt, the draught here is worse than ever.

Mel.
Yes, that window I think -- 

Toby.
Exactly, there's a current somewhere that plays old gooseberry with us.

Mrs. W.
Well, well, Mary, for goodness' sake put the screen between us and the window.

Mary.
The screen mum -- what screen? 
(Aside.)
There it is again, nothing can possibly screen me -- I'm the miserablest young 'oman -- 

Mrs. W.
There, there is the screen!

Mary.
Deary me, is this a screen? La only think!

Toby.
Screen! of course it is. 
(Aside.)
I don't care a curse who is discovered, my exalted situation exalts me above these little persons.

Luc. (Aside.) 
Dey pull down him screen! First all conspire to drive me into corner, now all conspire to pull me out again. Eh, dat good thought, you broken nigger help to mancipate your brudder in distress, give him you old clothes, now you tumble out ob dem. 
(Dresses himself in the clothes of broken figure,) 

Mary.
The screen mum -- I'm sure a worse draught would come in if the screen was moved -- much worse. I shivers at the very thought of it. Ugh-h-h -- 

Toby. (Whispers Mary .) 
It's no use my dear, dash boldly in at once, fate determines the crisis shall come sooner or later -- see how easy I take it. 
(Aside.)
In half a minute, my eye, what a rumpus!

Luc.
Dere! 
(Jumping on pedestal and taking attitude.)
me turn myself to wax. If me found out, me keep up de resemblance, and melt away wid my own grief.

Mrs. W.
What an extraordinary girl, hesitates at every thing. Move the screen this instant!

Mary.
There mum, there! 
(She pushes down the screen and discovers Lucius , as the figure, she falls on her knees without turning to look at him.)
I won't never do it no more, mum; never no more -- It's the first time.

Mrs. W.
First time of what?

Maria.
Why Mary, what is the matter?

Mel.
The poor girl is afflicted at something!

Mary.
What don't you see that, eh 
(looks round still kneeling, and sees Lucius as figure.)
Ha! ha! ha! Ha! ha! ha!

Toby.
Why, yes, its devilish good -- Ha! ha! ha! 
(Aside.)
He had an active situation just now. Now he has a fixed one.

Mary. (Rising.) 
He's an ingenious cretur to be sure. Ha! ha! ha!

Mrs. W.
The oddest girl! always laughing, or crying, and no one knows why.

Mel.
A remarkable fine figure that, "Pity the poor African."

Luc. (Aside.) 
Ah, dat well written. Him poor African much to be pitied.

Mrs. W.
But what made you fall on your knees, girl?

Mary.
Why, the fact is, you told me, you know, not to enter that cupboard. 
(Points R. )
Mum, -- and I did, that's all.

Mrs. W.
I'm excessively angry. Do you know if any one entered that cupboard with a light, there is a vessel of gas, and we might all be blown up?

Mary. (Alarmed.) 
Oh, goodness! Oh, uncle Dodds!

Toby.
Damn old Dodds, and his candle!

Luc. (Aside.) 
Dis bery nice situation. De house to be blown up, and me one ob de fixtures.

Tremendous explosion behind R. Dodds rushes out. Mrs. and Miss Dodds rush from cupboards screaming. Mrs. Warnmore and Maria sink into chairs. Lucius jumps from pedestal. Mary falls on her knees. Toby falls flat.

Toby. (Rising.) 
Its all over, I've gone through the operation.

Luc.
Me done for. Cuss playing statue, me blown atoms, here is de pieces. 
(Holds up broken arm and of the figure, which lay behind the pedestal.) 

[ Melford bears Maria off, L. 

Mrs. W.
Oh, my nerves never did receive such a shock, who can all these people be? Why, I must be blown next door.

Enter Boy, L.

Boy.
Please, ma'am, the gentleman who was here, has gone off with Miss Maria, in a post chaise, and left word with me, that you never wou'd see her again, till she was Mrs. -- Mrs, Melford, I think he called it.

Mrs. W.
Really! Every one makes himself pretty easy in my house? As for Mary, leave the house this instant

Luc.
And what matter? me got good massa, says me may hab wife, what say you, missee? my face black, but my heart not so black as dat nassy massa Toby's.

Mary.
There's my hand, there arn't no time to stand shilly shally. I walks out of my place into matrimony, as for this 'ere place, I'm glad I leaves it, for when there's so many kind friends 
(To Audience.)
as comes to see me, with smiling faces, I should think it the greatest punishment to be told I should have " No Followers !"
