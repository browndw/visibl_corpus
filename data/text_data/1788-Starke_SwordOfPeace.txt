Act I

Scene 1

[SCENE, a Room at Mrs. Tartar's. Enter Eliza and Louisa Moreton.]

Eliza
Well, Louisa, here we are, safe arrived on the coast of Coromandel.

Louisa
And in good truth, Eliza, I wish we were safe shipp'd off again.

Eliza
Whither away so fast, good coz! nay, nay -- but let us receive our fortunes first -- and truly, for my part, terra firma, though even such a sandy, dry soil as this is, suits my feelings better than the wat'ry elements.

Louisa
I don't know what state your feelings are in, but I'm sure mine have been tortured from the first moment I set foot on land.

Eliza
Why, I grant you, as fine ladies of delicate sentiments, and heroic modesty, ours have been pretty well tried! or rather, we have been struggling hard against the stream of prejudice, and custom, to preserve ourselves from their effects.

Louisa
And which is a point I still doubt; for our hostess -- good, now, what think you of her?

Eliza
Why, for our well-beloved lady hostess, dear Madam Tartar, I think we shall find her blue-cast, or half-cast complexion, the fairest part of her composition. -- But notwithstanding her hauteur, I shall teach her the difference between women who come here to make their fortunes, and those who only come to receive them.

Louisa
If I cou'd have foreseen we should have been placed in the house of such a being as this Mrs. Tartar, I would have forfeited my fortune (according to the strange clause in your father's will) rather than have come after it.

Eliza
No, no -- a truce with your delicacies to such an extream! Money, girl, is the universal good -- and we cannot expect to attain it any more than others without difficulties. -- My fate has already too severely prov'd what we are to expect without it! The man of my tenderest approbation torn from me by his mercenary rigid parents, and banish'd from his native home, because they then thought me friendless -- pennyless.

Louisa
True; but you have the exalted enthusiasm of love, (I may call it) to support you in the ideas of now seeking the amiable youth among these climes, and to reward him for his generous passion.

Eliza
Generous indeed! No severity cou'd make his heart abandon me, though hurried away he knew not whither. He cou'd only inform me 'twas to India, where, suffer what he might, his heart was ever mine.

Louisa
Therefore you have only to receive your fortune, and then begin your pursuit of your true knight, like any princess of ancient heroism, and I, your female Sancho, shall doubtless accompany you.

Eliza
In the true spirit of romance, let me say then, hail! hail! though land of mercenary interest, where love of gold destroys its thousands; where woman, lovely woman, for wealth and grandeur comes from far to sacrifice beauty, health, happiness! receive one votary to all-powerful love!

Louisa
Ah, never fear but we shall find him, Eliza; we have but to wait for their trade wind here, that blows all one way -- and then -- 

Eliza
A trade wind to waft one towards a lover! -- But you need be jeering me thus, coz, when you have a fifty times more romantic piece of business on your hands. -- Are not you seeking after a sword and its master -- and are point blank determin'd upon disarming the poor man wherever you meet him?

Louisa
True; and where a trade wind may be truly serviceable; for as the whole affair points directly towards his interest, there is little doubt of my disarming my gentleman without much resistance.

Eliza
Why, I grant you, there is little fear of any man's standing in the way of his interest; and yet, you know, the generous Clairville, deserted by a father, through Sir Thomas Clairville's generous assistance, sought a fortune here, denied him by a parent. Death put a stop to the noble youth's career, and has occasioned your commission of the sword, for which I honor Sir Thomas with enthusiasm.

Louisa
And he deserves it. -- His nobly offering the legacy Clairville's gratitude has left him, to purchase the sword of the deceas'd youth, that he may preserve it as a trophy of honor to his memory -- 

Eliza
An exertion of delicate, generous sensibility towards deceased merit, that characterizes Sir Thomas in that glorious singularity of an Englishman, who repays with munificent gratitude everlasting remembrance to the noble actions of their deceas'd heroes. -- Who wou'd not sacrifice life to be thus gloriously remembered?

Louisa
Well, if this Dormer, that possesses the sword at present, has but half as much generous sensibility, I doubt not presenting Sir Thomas Clairville with this Sword of Peace, at my return to England. -- So -- here comes our goodly hostess.

Eliza
Then a truce with sentiment, and we must hide our feelings, under a disguise impenetrable to her sharp eyes.

Louisa
It often surprises me, knowing what your heart thus suffers, you can command such ease, such life and spirits.

Eliza
Why those very sensations support me. -- the charming hope of what I seek supports my spirits, and actuates every thought. -- If we would be successful in every event of life, we must be active, help ourselves, and not depend on others: not be like this listless, helpless thing approaching; enervated more by indulgence and luxury, than the most baleful or pernicious heats of climate.

[Enter Mrs. Tartar, throwing herself on a Sopha as she speaks.]

Mrs. Tar.
Your servant, ladies. -- Lord -- how -- can you stand? -- I declare I am so -- heighho!

Eliza
I am sorry to see you so unwell, Madam.

Mrs. Tar.
Augh! unwell. -- Oh, the heat to day is so intense -- I am quite exhausted.

Eliza
Upon my word, from your example, Mrs. Tartar, I think we may be praying for our departure, if the climate is likely to affect us thus.

Louisa
Indeed it quite terrifies me! Lord bless me! she takes no notice -- I believe she has fainted.. -- Mrs. Tartar! -- Madam!

Eliza
Certainly she has -- poor soul! -- Here, Marianne! Tabina!

[Goes to Mrs. Tartar and fans her; so does Louisa, with two female slaves; -- at last she opens her eyes.]

Eliza and Louisa
How are you, Madam? -- Give her more air! open that door -- are you better?

Mrs. Tar.
Hey! -- 

Louisa
You had better be led into the air, Madam.

Mrs. Tar.
I'm not ill.

Eliza
No! why what's the matter then?

Mrs. Tar.
Nothing -- but -- mere -- in-do-lence.

Eliza.
[Aside, coming forward.] With no small share of in-so-lence. -- I must humble this Indian Princess, I see plainly.

Mrs. Tar.
[coming forward, speaking slow and affected with much pride.] Well, Ladies -- I have spoke to the Resident -- about your ridicu -- lous refusal of seeing company in form, and he is perfectly of my opinion -- that it must be over-ruled.

Eliza
Yes, Madam, I grant you, if we came to seek husbands; but that don't happen to be our errand.

Mrs. Tar.
It wou'd be better, Miss Moreton, if you treated that subject with more respect in this place, and look'd upon it in its proper light.

Eliza
I think I do, Madam, when I look upon it with the most sovereign contempt; and I sincerely hope the traffic will be abolished, as still more disgraceful to our sex than that of the poor slaves to a nation.

Mrs. Tar.
[speaking faster by degrees, and throwing herself into agitation.] Madam, I'd have you to know -- Miss Morton, I must insist, while you are in my house -- that you will please to act with propriety -- and not give such freedom to your tongue. -- [Eliza looks at her smilingly, and throws herself carelessly, as if she did not attend to her, into a chair. -- Mrs. Tartar, forgetting all her fine indolence, bridling and looking at Eliza, speaking quick] -- Truly, I don't understand such behaviour, and it must be alter'd -- it is sufficient that I condescend to the trouble of such visitors.

Louisa
Trouble! as to that, Madam, we shall be very happy to take the trouble off your hands. Our fortunes place us above mean obligations; nor shall we submit to any thing that has such an appearance.

Mrs. Tar.
In that, Madam, you must be guided by the Resident. -- His will is law here, and so you shall both find, if I have any power with him.

Louisa
Oh dear, Madam, I beg pardon; I did not know the Residant was under petticoat government. [Curtsies.]

Mrs. Tar.
It would be as well, Miss, if you kept your flippant remarks to yourself; as I may soon convince you, what is the respect I have a right to expect in this settlement. -- You, truly, with your volubility of tongue, and your cousin there with her still more insolent silence -- I suppose, Madam, you disdain to answer me. [to Eliza.]

Eliza
[still sitting and imitating Mrs. Tartar's manner.] My silence proceeds, Madam, -- from nothing but -- mere -- in -- do -- lence.

Louisa
Ha, ha, ha! -- [Joins Eliza in a stifled provoking laugh.]

Mrs. Tar.
Insufferable impertinence! -- But here comes the Resident, ladies; I suppose you will treat him with more respect.

Eliza.
[rising.] Oh yes, I shall prepare myself to make a curtsey to his Worship's honorable congee cap directly.

[Enter the Resident, dressed in a Banyan and congee Cap.]

Resident
Well, my little beauties of our hemisphere, how d'ye do? -- Efaith you both look divinely!

Eliza
Why we shou'd do very well, Sir, if Mrs. Tartar did not frighten us out of our wits. [looks piteously.]

Res.
Hey! hey! why -- why -- what the devil, Tartar, have you been doing to the sweet girls?

Mrs. Tar.
[in a disdainful contemptuous manner.] Why I have been attempting to teach the sweet girls, not to give themselves such sweet airs, and to treat other people with more respect, particularly Miss Eliza there.

Res.
What have you been at, you little bewitching gipsey you, to put Madam Tartar into such an agitation?

Eliza
[looking at him with an enchanting simplicity of manners.] Why, dear Sir -- nothing -- only -- only Mrs. Tartar's very angry with me, because I don't like to be -- to be kiss'd by all the five hundred gentlemen belonging to your presidency here; and -- and she says, you will make me.

Res.
Ha, ha, ha! Why to be sure it's the usual form to receive the visits of the factory at Ladies first arrival; and who would not wish to salute a pretty Lady, if he cou'd contrive it, you know? adod, it makes me long for a kiss myself.

Eliza
Very likely; but as it is your sex's privilege to ask, so it is ours to refuse; and to be oblig'd to be dress'd up in grand gala, stuck on a Sopha, at the upper end of a room, for three nights running, to be view'd at will -- as who should say -- what d'ye please to buy, gentlemen? Monstrous! and then submitting to the salute of every man that approaches one, is such an indelicate custom. --  

Res.
Well, but my little delicate one, you'll be look'd upon here in a very odd light, if you do not: adod, they may say breaths are sweetest at a distance! and I don't like my lovely girls shou'd be disparag'd.

Eliza
Had we arriv'd here, Sir (I am sorry to say) upon the general errand of our sex, it might be dangerous -- but -- 

Mrs. Tar.
[advancing in a twitter.] But, Miss Moreton, I must insist -- 

Eliza
Nay, now, good Mrs. Tartar, don't hurry yourself -- you and I shall never agree on this subject: for though I despise prudery, I cannot bear any thing which degrades my sex. -- No one has a greater flow of spirits, or more laughing chearfulness than myself, by some ill-naturedly term'd coquetry; but call it caprice, affectation, (what you please, Ma'am,) while it tends to modest decorum and reserve, let no one of my sex be so wanting to herself as to condemn me.

Res.
Adod, though I don't understand one of these fine sentiments, yet I love to hear her talk' em.

Eliza
And as to respect, Madam, please to remember that my rank and fortune in this place gives me a right to think myself the first woman in it.

Res.
And in truth so you are, and so you shall be, my little charmer.

Mrs. Tar
I fancy in that point, Sir, you forget yourself, and other people, strangely.

Res.
Don't forget myself at all, Madam -- never do. -- I know I am the first man in the settlement; and if I please to make Eliza Moreton here, the first woman in it, there are no other people can or shall hinder it.

Mrs. Tar
No, Sir! -- Sir -- I -- I -- however this is not a time I shall chuse for discussing that point; but we shall see hereafter who has most right to that, Eliza Moreton, truly, or myself. [Exit.]

Eliza
I am afraid, Sir, I am misunderstood here; I wish not to infringe upon Mrs. Tartar's rights, or any one's, but merely to assert my own.

Res.
Oh! oh! oh! my little queen, don't mind her -- every body here knows Tartar's a vixen; but she shan't manage me, I can tell her.

Louisa
But yet, Sir, by her hints, she seems to have more right over you than you chuse to avow.

Res.
Oh, oh! no such thing -- to be sure I -- I don't deny but I have gallanted her a bit -- and -- and -- and -- been a little particular, and so forth -- Tartar has a large fortune -- and -- and women have been rather scarce here of late -- and so -- and so -- but if I meet with another pleases me better -- nay, you know -- why (leering at Eliza) an't I Resident? and sure hard, if so, I mayn't please myself, ha! ha! ha! -- Well -- but -- but do you intend to shut yourselves up here and see nobody? or how -- 

Eliza
Ah! Heavens forbid! no, Sir, all extremes are dangerous.

Res.
Well, well, I know nothing about that; but you must take heed of our young men here -- all, poor devils! will be running after you both for your fortunes -- there is not a man, except a friend or two of my own, worthy of either of you -- Now there's Supple, for example, my secretary, a lad of discernment, and the most rising man in the settlement.

Eliza
Supple truly! [with contempt.] He may make a very convenient secretary, Sir, perhaps; but -- 

Res.
But what? Indeed, Eliza, he's the greatest favorite I have in the place -- you must not judge of him so hastily -- you don't know Supple; you don't know him.

Eliza
Nor do I ever desire it, I assure you, Sir. He may do mighty well to get our baggage on shore, see that the piano is carefully unpack'd, the chariot not scratch'd, or the high varnish injur'd, or such kind of services; which is all the consequence I should ever think of giving Mr. Supple.

Louisa
[innocently.] Dear me! I thought that was his situation by all his officious attentions on our first landing; a kind of maitre d'hotel to you, Sir, as Resident here: I didn't know the man rank'd here as a gentleman.

Res.
A gentleman, child! why Supple's of a very ancient family; and all the Supples have ever been, and still are, in all the best situations of life -- no, no, he's not like the extravagant puppies here, spending more than they get every one of them; and I should be sorry, as the friend of your father, and uncle, girls, you shou'd be sacrific'd to such fellows.

Louisa
Oh, dear, Sir, you need not fear us, I promise you.

Res.
What? I warrant you pretend you never think of being married, hey?

Louisa
No, Sir; we have not vow'd against marrying in India; but I believe it's very unlikely.

Res.
And why so, why so? what says my Eliza, hey? your own fault, you gipsey, if you don't get the first match in the place -- And as for you, my little heart, am not I Resident? who'll dare refuse my recommendation?

Louisa
O, Sir, cry you mercy -- and yet there is one gentleman I wish you to get me to the acquaintance of; and that is a Lieutenant Dormer, as I am entrusted with a very particular commission to him.

Eliza
Oh yes, by all means; nor shall we feel satisfied till we have executed it.

Res.
A commision with Dormer? why he's -- 

Louisa
Not dead I hope, Sir.

Res.
Dead! no, no; though he might as well be, for the good of him. A proud, self-sufficient puppy, and as poor as the devil! Why, what can you have to do with him?

Louisa
Why, Sir, he was very intimate with a young officer here, of the name of Clairville, who died, and left him his sword as a legacy; my commission is to procure that sword of him if possible.

Res.
Sword! for what?

Eliza
That it may be laid up as a lasting trophy in his family, a monument of their attachment to his noble worth. -- And Sir Thomas Clairville has commission'd Louisa to expend the whole five thousand pounds that his nephew's grateful heart left him as a legacy, rather than not procure it.

Res.
Five thousand pounds to Dormer! give him five thousand devils! I desire, Louisa, you will be very cautious in this affair; the fellow's poor, I know, and much distress'd, (for all his pride attempts to conceal it,) and with proper management you may get this sword for five hundred rupees. Let me contrive it, and I don't doubt getting it for a mere nothing.

Louisa
Pardon me, Sir; I will never disgrace Sir Thomas's generous meaning, by such oeconomy. I will do it handsomely, or not at all.

Res.
Pooh! nonsense, child; why do you consider you are making the fellow's fortune at once?

Eliza
So much the better, Sir, in my opinion.

Res.
Better, truly! -- make him as proud as the devil, and he will think himself as great as me in a fortnight. no, no, it must not be done, I tell you; and as for that Clairville -- all this is mighty fine, but I never lik'd him in my life, and so I always took care to convince him, when I had it in my power.

Louisa
I am sorry, Sir, your opinion and mine are so different; but I must beg you not to interfere in the affair, as I have promis'd Sir Thomas to follow his instructions, and his only.

Res.
Well, well, if Sir Thomas is so ridiculous, I can't help it -- I didn't know your great folks were so rich in England -- but I know you may get it for a mere trifle if you go properly to work; for, I tell you this, Dormer is damn'd poor.

Louisa
Then, Sir, you have bound me to offer him nothing less than all; for perish that prudence that can take advantage of another's distress.

Res.
Hey day! why at this rate, child, you wou'd ruin yourself in a month -- what say you, my little beauty, isn't it downright madness?

Eliza
Indeed, Sir, I am perfectly of the opinion of my honorable friend that spoke last, and vote the five thousand pounds with the utmost alacrity.

Res.
It's to be hoped you'll be more cautious of your own fortunes; this, to be sure, is Sir Thomas's, and so it don't much signify.

Louisa
There is also, Sir, a Mr. David Northcote, executor to Clairville's will; what kind of a man is he?

Res.
Oh, he'll just suit your ideas, I can tell you, for one can do no business but in he pops his nose to counteract every thing that don't tally with his ridiculous notions about honor, generosity, benevolence, and stuff: as if that had any thing to do with trade.

Louisa
My commission, Sir, is founded upon generosity, and shall be conducted by honor and delicacy -- however unfit therefore this Mr. Northcote may be calculated for trade, he will be highly necessary in the commission thus assign'd to him of benevolence.

Res.
Nay, for that matter, he is one of the richest free merchants we have in India.

Eliza
I am glad to find by that, Sir, his strange out-of-the-way notions (as you term them) has not injur'd his own concerns in trade, though it gives him spirit enough to counteract the petty finesses practis'd by others: for my part, I am already anxious to be acquainted with him; your account of him charms me.

Res.
My account! why, why, hey day! I never spoke well of him in my life, nor never shall, that's more; and my account truly charms you! nor will you ever get acquainted with him through me, I can tell you. You may perhaps see him at the ball, indeed, that is, if you accept the one I intend giving this evening on your account, as is always customary on ladies arrival: but as you object so to -- 

Eliza
Pardon me, Sir; don't imagine because we protest against absurd customs, we wish to refuse those attentions our situations and our sex are entitled to; and we trust, Sir, our appearance and behaviour will not disgrace the protection you afford us.

Res.
Well, well, then I'll bid you good morning.

Louisa
You won't forget to send Lieutenant Dormer, Sir.

Res.
No, no: -- when will you chuse to see him?

Eliza
Oh, the sooner the better.

Res.
Ay, ay, by all means; do a foolish action as soon as you can, that you may have the more time left for repentance. [Exit.]

Eliza
I fancy, Louisa, by Mr. Resident's abrupt departure, he looks upon us as a couple of extravagant, romantic creatures! I hope it will cure the ridiculous passion I dreadfully fear he is rather inclin'd to declare for poor me -- didn't you mind Mrs. Tartar and him?

Louisa
Oh, yes; and I doubt not her spite and malice are sufficiently stirr'd up against us both -- yonder she appears -- for Heaven's sake let us avoid the termagent by returning to our own apartments.

Eliza
Aye, let us make our escape! for, in truth, it's too hot at present to endure scolding, or being scolded, or school'd; all which we shall most certainly encounter if we don't escape -- therefore allons, ma chere amie! [Exeunt.]

Act II

Scene 1

[SCENE, Jeffrey discovered sitting at a Table, in a loose Banyan, leaning on the Table with his Elbow.]

Jeffrey
Heighho! -- I am devilishly low spirited -- fellow's advice to take care of my health has almost kill'd me -- I wish I had met my old acquaintance, Dick Pestle, any where else: now in England I shou'd call him a damn'd rascally son of an apothecary, that wanted to run up a bill with me -- but here it seems they get nothing by killing people; so he has been advising me how to preserve my health -- yes -- that liver complaint he talks of is so common -- ah! I'm certainly going to have it. [Feeling his stomach and sides.] -- Let's see -- he said walking was good -- ah! well, I'll walk then -- I'm certainly going to have it [Walks backwards and forwards very quick while he speaks the rest.] -- and my poor dear young ladies too -- two to one but we're all three buried in one grave, in this Mazaga ha gag ha -- damn the name -- I've got it wrote down here, but for the foul of me, I can neither read it nor spell it, so that when I return home, I shan't even be able to tell where I've been. [Bell rings.] So! my ladies want me, and I han't got my coat back -- Here, Caesar!

[Enter Caesar. A black Slave.]

Jef.
Have you brush'd my coat yet?

Caesar
I carry it, Massa.

Jef.
Carried it -- where? I bid you brush it.

Caesar
I carry it to Pompey, Mass.

Jef.
Well, then, go and fetch it back again -- [Bell Rings.] -- my lady's bell rings, don't you hear? and I must attend her.

Caesar
No, Massa,; Thomas vil bring it ven it's brush.

Jef.
Hey! why, what the vengeance, you and Pompey, and Thomas, and I don't know who! to take and brush a coat, and my lady ringing all the while for me, you black rascal!

Caesar
Vy she no ring for me, Massa.

Jef.
But can I go to her without my coat, you stupid animal? run and fetch it, you dog, this minute.

Caesar
No, Massa; I carry it -- I no fetch it. -- [Walks up the stage very composedly.]

Jef.
Why, you impudent black rascal -- if ever -- now cou'd I swear myself into a passion with these damn'd dogs of Blackamoors -- but, oh, my liver! -- come hither you rascal -- you a slave, quotha! why, you dog, do you know you possess all the impudence of liberty, without seeming to know any thing of the matter?

Caesar
Ah, Massa, me no liberty!

Jef
Why, you dog, don't you take the liberty only to do what you please? why there is not a servant in all England more his own master than you are; why I have as easy a place as man can have with my young ladies, but do you think they and their family would have advanc'd me to a servant out of livery, as I am now, if I had given myself such airs as you do?

Caesar
Give myself no airs, Massa; only do as de rest do -- Ah, Massa! you tink ve poor blacks know noting, but me can feel -- me slave! [Shakes his head and sighs.]

Jef.
Why an't you fed, cloth'd, and kept to do nothing? what wou'd you have more?

Caesar
Yes, Massa; der is my lady's fine bird I do de same by -- but if I leave de cage door open -- ah, vil he no fly avay? -- but no talk of dis -- it make me sick here. [Points to his heart.]

Jef.
Hah! why so?

Caesar
Ah! I loss good Massa, I love dearly -- He made great deal money; and he vas give me liberty, dear liberty! ven ve vas got to your country -- but he dies just as he vas go aboard ship -- broke my heart -- left poor me slave!

Jef.
Poor fellow! I pity you for that -- How came you here?

Caesar
Oh, dey sell me vid de horse, and de good, and de house -- all dis vas his; and to live here make me more sad, because me love my Massa, he so good to de poor blacks.

Jef.
Damme if I don't pity you from my soul for this.

Caesar
Ah! I vas live -- fly for my Massa -- 'cause I love him dearly -- now no good Massa -- no joy -- no heart -- 

Jef.
Now, if I cou'd manage to buy this poor fellow, and make him a present of himself, how I shou'd make him stare! Harkee, my lad, as you don't seem of much use in this family, do you think your lady wou'd part with you? Shou'd you like to serve me and go over to England?

Caesar
Oh, Massa! yes, yes -- [leaps for joy.] -- me love England, 'cause my old Massa love it -- he hate India -- so do I.

Jef.
Well, then, I'll speak to your lady.

Caesar
No, no, Massa, lady know nothing of me; Mr. Norton is de chum of de house -- you speak to him -- Massa often say, in passion, he sell me.

Jef.
Oh, very well -- a damn'd unconscionable dog though, I find him to be -- so if he can get any thing by it, I don't doubt his consent; for, I believe he'd sell his own skin if he cou'd spare it -- [Bell rings.] -- the bell rings again -- you dog will you fetch my coat now?

Caesar
Yes, yes, Massa -- I run -- I fly for good Massa. [Runs off.]

Jef.
There, there's a proof these poor devils don't know when they're well us'd truly -- if I can but procure this poor fellow his liberty -- by Heavens the very thought warms my heart -- though I han't done much harm, never did much good -- so now it's time to begin. [Exit after Caesar.]

[SCENE, An open Walk. Enter Lieutenant Dormer and Mr. Supple.]

Dor.
Attend you to the Resident's, dy'e say, Mr. Supple?

Sup.
Yes, yes, you must go with me directly, Dormer, to the Miss Moreton's -- and, egad, you must take care of your heart, for, I can tell you, they are enchanting creatures! the eldest, Eliza, I find, is the Resident's favorite, and the match is all concluded already -- he has agreed to settle all her own fortune on her, besides an immense jointure from the old Don, and ten thousand pounds worth of jewels into the bargain.

Dor.
I think she ought to have had a great deal more, to have induc'd her to accept such a match.

Sup.
Such a match! why do you consider she makes herself the first woman here, with the likelihoods of being a young brilliant widow in a very short space? considerations, let me tell you, of immense weight, and which no woman that comes out to India can possibly refuse.

Dor.
Well, then, there's no great danger for the heart of a poor Lieutenant of Seapoys.

Sup.
No, to be sure, you can't possibly have any chance with either of them -- but I was willing to caution you, because handsome young fellows are often too apt to be conceited of themselves.

Dor.
Sir, I'm infinitely oblig'd to you for your kind advice. [Bowing.]

Sup.
Besides, [conceitedly] as the Resident's my particular friend, and you know my consequence on that account is not very small, I intend making proposals to the other myself.

Dor.
Umph! so I suspected.

Sup.
Therefore you see how the case stands, and that it is not possible you can be supposed to make any advantage of this accident that introduces you to their notice.

Dor.
You might have spar'd yourself all this trouble, good Mr. Supple; for I have too much spirit to lay myself open to a repulse, by aspiring to an honor my humble fortune dare not pretend to -- but, as you are so very communicative, I shou'd be very glad if you wou'd inform me what business these ladies can possibly have with me.

Sup.
Oh! it's a strange romantic affair -- but I'm desired to say nothing about it -- so come along, for my time is of consequence! [Exit.]

Dor.
There's no making any thing of this fellow -- but I have often heard my friend Edwards speak highly of these young ladies -- but, I know not why, my heart's all agitation.

[Exit after Supple.]

[SCENE, A Room in Mrs. Tartar's House. Eliza and Louisa discovered.]

Eliza
Where can Jeffreys be! I have rung for him this half hour. Have you sent him any where, Louisa?

Louisa
Not I -- I suppose he is diverting himself with all the things and people he sees here, so different from any thing he ever saw before! -- I'll ring again -- oh, here he is.

[Enter Jeffreys, with the Ribbon of his Hair in his Hand, and his Hair hanging loose down his Back.]

Eliza
Why, Jeffreys, I have been ringing for you this half hour.

Jef.
O lord, yes, Ma'am; and I've heard you all the time. I shall certainly go distracted, ladies, in this Mazag-ha-ga-gaga -- this place here with its hard name.

Louisa
Why so, Jeffreys?

Jef.
Why, Ma'am, here are so many Blackamoors kept to do nothing, that nothing can I get done -- I was without my coat, Madam, when you rung, [to Eliza] and was obliged to wait the leisure of half a dozen of them before I cou'd attend your orders -- for he that takes your coat won't brush it -- he that brushes it won't bring it -- and he that brings it, egad he won't put it on -- so there was Thomas, Godfrey, and Caesar to do what any lad in England wou'd have done by himself. -- And Caesar (in my hurrying him) pulls off the ribbon of my hair, which it seems, belongs to the province of a damn'd Gentoo fellow, that's gone out into the fields to eat his dinner, and having left me, I must wait, unless I can tie it myself, until his return -- though there are fifteen of these black gentry loit-ring about there, doing nothing.

Eliza
Ha! ha! ha! poor Jeffreys! but you must consider it is owing to the heat of the climate.

Jef.
I rather believe, Ma'am, it's owing to pride and vanity of their employers. -- I beg, ladies, I may have all your commands at least a week or two beforehand, or I shall never be able to get them executed.

[Pulls out a long Paper that falls one End of it on the Ground.]

Louisa
Mercy on us! Jeffreys, what's that! the bill of fare of the dinner the Resident gives us to-morrow?

Jef.
Oh, no, Madam; by what I can learn, that won't be so over-long -- no, Madam, this is a list of the servants and slaves that belong to the retinue of Mrs. Tartar, with an account of what they don't do, which I have had written out.

Louisa
Why so, Jeffreys?

Jef.
I'll tell you, Madam; suppose I want to order your carriage, I may have half a dozen of these gentry at my elbow, and yet not one of 'em the one I must apply to, or that will fetch him -- so that I cou'd sooner, in England, get to the presence of His Majesty himself, than through this croud of attendants waiting on the state of Mrs. Tartar, originally the daughter of a tallow chandler in England.

Eliza
How do you know that, Jeffreys?

Jef.
O, Madam, ever thing is known here; for I have heard more about many of my acquaintance in England, than I ever suspected there! -- Yes, Madam, Mrs. Tartar's father was a tallow chandler, who, thinking he might retrieve a broken fortune in England, repair'd to this place, where he soon married a black merchant's daughter, with a great deal of money, and died worth a million or two -- Miss was sent over to her father's relations, in St. Mary Axe, for education, and at her return, married Mr. Tartar, who originally was the son and heir of a basket-maker in St. Giles.

[Enter a black Servant.]

Ser.
Here one gentleman, want one lady.

Jef.
Coming directly. [Exit.]

Eliza
Perhaps this may be Dormer.

Louisa
If it is, cousin, do you speak to him; for you know my aukward bashfulness to strangers.

[Re-enter Jeffreys.]

Jef.
There are two gentlemen without, Madam, from the Resident, and have sent in this note.

Eliza
Two -- then it can't be Dormer. -- [Opens the Note and reads -- Louisa looking over her.] -- Um-um -- my particular friend, Mr. Timothy Supple, who will introduce him -- a man I have the utmost respect and affection for -- hang Mr. Timothy Supple -- to introduce Dormer by such a fellow! well! we must not keep 'em without -- conduct the gentlemen in, Jeffreys.

[Exit Jeffreys.]

Louisa
None but such an unfeeling mind as his, wou'd have sent another person to be present on such an occasion.

[Enter Supple and Dormer.]

[Dormer dressed as a Lieutenant of Seapoys, with such a Broadsword by his Side as Officers of the Horse wear.]

Sup.
Ladies, your most obedient! I have the honor of paying my adorations to the most beautiful of women that ever grac'd our settlement. -- Ah, gods! what are we to do, Ladies? the Resident has eternally bound me to him by this distinction.

[Eliza during the above speech draws herself up with much cold and haughty reserve. Louisa looks down disconcerted and very grave, both curtseying very distantly to his compliments.]

Eliza
How free the fellow is! Is that gentleman Lieutenant Dormer, Sir! (to Supple. -- Dormer bows respectfully.)

Sup.
Yes, Ma'am. -- Ah, ah, ah! egad, Dormer I had forgot you; the sight of so much beauty had eclipsed every other idea. -- Yes, Madam, I have brought Lieutenant Dormer to attend your commands about this said --  [Dormer bows.]

Eliza.
Commands! you mistake the affair much, Sir; our commission consists in begging a very particular favor of that gentleman: -- but as it is a delicate subject, Sir, cannot well be discussed before any one not concerned.

Sup.
Oh dear, Madam, I know the whole business; you need not mind me -- the Resident has acquainted me. -- Indeed I may venture to assert, without vanity, there are a few things by him kept secret from me; indeed does me the honor to consult me upon every occasion.

Eliza
Perhaps so, Sir; but you being the Resident's confident, is not reason you shou'd be our's.

Sup.
Damn it, how she cuts me. -- [Aside.] -- Nay, as to that, Madam, ha, ha! I wish you to accept my services, out of my profound respect to the Resident; and however meanly you, Madam, seem to rate my consequence here, perhaps you may find it not amiss to cultivate it.

[With arrogance.]

Eliza
Sir, if the rectitude of my own conduct cannot support me -- 

Sup.
Umph! ha, ha, ha! As to that, Madam those are speculations I never trouble my head about, not I. -- Here, Dormer, you must understand that that sword of your's -- 

Dor.
[Spiritedly.] I shall understand nothing, Sir, communicated by you against the wish of these Ladies.

Sup.
Hey! why what the devil! you in heroics too! Egad, if that's the case, I must e'en wish you all a good morning, and go and pay my respects to Mrs. Tartar. -- Ladies, your most obedient -- Lieutenant Dormer, good bye to you. -- [Bows affectedly.] -- Damn the fellow, that I had but courage enough to cut his throat! [Exit.]

Eliza
[To Dormer.] Let me intreat you, Sir, to excuse this disagreeable reception, but it has entirely arisen from your extraordinary Gentleman Usher.

Dor.
I am truly sorry, Ladies, to have been thus disagreeably introduc'd to you; but it was the Resident's doing, and I cou'd only obey.

Louisa
Vastly unthinking of him, in every respect.

Dor.
However, Ladies, assure yourselves I await your commands with the utmost submission. [Bows.]

Eliza
We have none, Sir, upon any such consideration; on the contrary, we depend on your generosity to grant us a very important service.

Dor.
Alas! Madam, a poor Lieutenant of Seapoys stands in no likelihood of being so fortunate as to confer favors, or receive any.

Eliza
Not to keep you, Sir, any longer in suspense, and hoping you will excuse the liberty I mean to take, as Mr. Supple was so officiously preparing to acquaint you; it respects that very sword, I fancy, you have by your side.

Dor.
Madam, you throw me into still greater perplexities; this sword, Madam --  [Sighs.]

Eliza
Was the legacy of a beloved friend.

Dor.
Yes, Madam; but how, or wherefore, can that concern you?

Eliza
To honor that friend's memory with everlasting glory and remembrance, depends solely on you, Sir, and that sword.

Dor.
You more and more increase my wonder, Madam. -- Honor him I ever shall with an enthusiasm, friendship alone can inspire.

Eliza
Then, Sir, you have a glorious opportunity to exert it. Your friend's noble relation in England, Sir Thomas Clairville, will deem that sword cheaply purchas'd in exchanging his legacy for yours.

Dor.
What, Madam, sell it! part with it -- not for millions; unworthy shou'd I prove myself of his dying tenderness! No, Madam, if it cannot more nobly get me bread, it shall deprive me sooner of existence.

Eliza
You do not see the affair in its proper light, Sir; it is not selling, it is exchanging it, and for the noblest purpose. Sir Thomas covets it to remain for ever in his family, a noble attestation to the exalted worth of its too unfortunate owner, preserved amongst banners and trophies of his dignified ancestors, as reflecting higher honor and more true glory as the relic of a noble, generous, and grateful heart.

Dor.
But it must not be by fixing the disgrace of a mercenary on mine. No, madam -- I am but a poor Lieutenant, yet such will I remain. -- If I can't enrich myself without mercenary views, without tarnishing the honor of a British soldier, yet think me not so selfish to prefer my own slight satisfaction to my deceas'd friend's glory. -- I honor Sir Thomas's motive -- it speaks him what an Englishman should be. -- His gifts be to himself. -- but -- take the sword -- though parting with it -- leaves me wretched.

Eliza
Excuse me, Sir; it is my cousin's commission, though her diffidence and delicacy have forc'd me to the explanation of it.

Louisa
What my cousin has told you is the real fact, Sir.

Dor.
To you then, Madam, I resign that sword, which not the most potent enemy shou'd have forc'd from me but with my life; -- yet friendship is stronger than power, and beauty irresistable as fate! Oh, Clairville! receive this proof of my attachment. -- If thy blessed spirit is permitted to observe it long -- long may this remain a trophy to thy merits; and as it never was drawn but in thy country's service, -- [taking it from his side] -- may it to ages hence convey thy noble worth. -- No paltry quarrels, murderous duels, ever stain'd thy blade -- nor was it ever yet unsheath'd to countenance oppression, wrong, or robbery. -- I have kept thee as a jewel next my heart; sleeping or waking thou hast still been with me! and humbly hope (without a boast) I part with thee as unsullied as ever I receiv'd thee. -- Go, and record thy master's -- [kisses it with enthusiasm] -- sad, untimely fate -- cut off from every blessing that awaited him, by an obnoxious climate's desolating heats.

[Kneeling, presents the sword to Louisa, who, taking it, rests the point on the ground, supporting it by the hilt with her left hand; the other hiding her tears with her handkerchief. -- Eliza also weeping. -- Dormer rising, hurries off.]

Eliza
Oh, Dormer! thou hast prov'd thyself the worthy -- what, is he gone?

Louisa
[Looks up and puts her handkerchief to her eyes again, sobbing.] -- Noble, generous youth!

Eliza
Indeed, he is. -- But come, Louisa, we need not cry all day, -- [jogs her] -- though I'm afraid we shall find this sword a dangerous weapon if I mistake not. I fear it has given your heart a mortal wound already -- hey, coz -- what say you? how d'ye feel it?

Louisa
Dear Eliza, how can you give way to such levity? [Rather peevishly.]

Eliza
Nay, don't scold, especially sword in hand, good coz. -- In good faith, I'll e'en call him back to my protection -- and here he comes, as I live.

Louisa
[starting.] Good heaven, he must have heard you, cousin.

[Re-enter Dormer.]

Dor.
Forgive me, Ladies -- perhaps it is a weakness -- but the sword-knot was my Clairville's! That if you would bestow upon me -- 

Eliza
Come, don't you set me a crying again, you strange man you, don't -- Here -- we don't know what to do with our wish now we have got it. -- There's no other way -- you must keep the sword for us, 'till we can return to England -- but be sure you bring it us every day, and ten times a day, that we may be sure it is safe.

Dor.
Ah dear, Madam! trust me not with it again, for fear temptation -- 

Louisa
There is no fear of that, Sir; a heart once capable of such a generous action, will never be tempted to repent it.

Dor.
I am bound eternally, Madam, by your generous confidence.

Eliza
Not that we wish to conceal your noble generosity; but there are some people, who can never forgive a man for putting their own conduct in a despicable light by the superiority of his own. -- [Giving the sword.] -- Such you have at present to deal with in the Resident, and this his precious confidant.

Dor.
I am happy, Ladies, your discernment is equal to their characters. -- You will excuse my saying more.

Eliza
Readily.

[Re-enter Mr. Supple.]

Sup.
Well, Ladies! I hope you and Dormer have settled this affair -- for upon my soul I cannot help interrupting you. -- I have been discoursing with Mrs. Tartar about you both, till I have work'd up my feelings to such a pitch of enthusiasm, I cou'd no longer, Ladies, resist coming to throw my adorations at your feet.

[Makes extravagant gestures, and bows of adoration to them both, but particularly Louisa.]

Louisa
[very formally.] You do us more honor, Sir, than either we deserve -- 

Eliza
[curtseying and looking archly.] Or desire. [Ladies go up.]

Sup.
Oh, my dearest Madam, pardon me there. -- [Bows conceitedly.] -- They seem all so dev'lish queer, I suppose they han't agreed -- besides, I see the sword's by his side still. -- I am ready to attend you, Dormer, if the Ladies and you -- 

Dor.
Sir, I am at your service. Ladies, I humbly take my leave. [Bowing respectfully.]

Eliza
Mr. Dormer, Sir, your servant; we shall hope to see you again before to-morrow.

Dor.
Madam, you do me too much honor. [Bows.]

Sup.
Oh! I suppose they are at a parley. -- Damn it, I think she might have ask'd me too. -- Ladies, I kiss your hands till my happy stars return me an opportunity of again adoring your beauties.

Louisa
Mr. Dormer, we hope to see you soon, Sir.

[Eliza and Louisa both curtsey very gravely, with peaking, and exeunt as Dormer is going off opposite.]

Sup.
[aside as he goes off.] Dormer gone too! Damn it, they make nobody of me here -- they're the oddest women I ever saw in my life, egad. I never said half so many fine things to any of their sex before, without turning their heads with vanity and affectation. [Exit after Dormer.]

Act III

Scene 1

[SCENE, a Chamber. Enter Jeffreys; Caesar from the opposite Side.]

Jeffreys
Come hither, Cesar; I've something for you at last. -- I have agreed with Norton about you, and an unconscionable dog he is; but damme, I cou'd not bear to stand hagling about a fellow creature.

Caesar [leaps for joy.]
Oh, Massa -- bless you, Massa -- am I den your slave now, Massa, I sarve you faithly.

[Puts Jeffrey's hand on his head, and bows his body in token of submission.]

Jef.
No, Caesar; you are no slave of mine -- you are no slave of mine -- you are -- 

Caesar [looks surprised.]
Did you no say, Massa, you agree for me?

Jef.
Yes, my good lad; but for fear I shou'd die too, like your old master, I will give you your liberty now, while I have the power. -- You are free, Caesar; I make you so; but I wou'd not mention my intention to you before, lest it might be disappointed.

Caesar
Massa [astonished] give me liberty! oh, Massa! Massa! Massa! Mass -- 

[First he speaks loud, then fainter and fainter, till he faints away in Jeffrey's arms, who catches him.]

Jef
Hey, hey, Caesar -- why Caesar! what the devil shall I do now? I've certainly kill'd him; and, damme, I shall get hang'd for my generosity without benefit of clergy! lord! lord! for they'll never believe I have kill'd him with kindness. -- Why, Caesar! a pretty piece of work this! -- Ah, Jeffreys, you have cross'd the line to a pretty purpose, truly -- just to be tuck'd up o' the other side on't. -- The fellow's certainly dead, and I've freed his soul instead of his body. -- Stay -- he moves; -- why, Caesar, you dog, damme, you've frighted me out of my wits.

Caesar
Oh, Massa! you kill me vid good -- you give poor black liberty. -- He die vid joy! -- Ah, Massa, I kiss your feet.

[Falls flat on the ground, embracing his feet.]

Jef.
No, Caesar; get up; be a good fellow and a faithful friend, that's the best way of expressing your thanks.

Caesar [rising]
Dear Massa, you so good! you break my heart. -- [weeping.] -- My joy -- feel sad -- oh, never -- never make you mends, dear, dear Massa.

Jef.
I'm not your Master, Caesar, but your friend. -- Give me your hand, my lad; and let me see by your spirit and bravery you deserve freedom.

Caesar
Friend oh vil you vite man be so kind to call poor black friend? de black mans he fight for his friend -- bleed for his friend -- die for him -- starve for him -- every ting for his friend. -- But oh, Massa, I must call you Massa; for me feel, me love you like my old Massa.

Jef.
Well, we won't fall out about that now; but, you dog, I must make you a lad of spirit, like an Englishman, or else, what's your liberty good for?

Caesar
Ah, Massa, I free! I like you! -- Am I Englishman? -- oh teach me be Englishman.

Jef.
That I will, you rogue. -- An Englishman -- ay, he lives as he likes -- lives where he likes -- goes where he likes -- stays where he likes -- works if he likes -- lets it alone, if he likes -- starves, if he likes -- abuses who he likes -- boxes who he likes -- thinks what he likes -- speaks what he thinks --  for, damme, he fears nothing, and will face the devil.

[Clinching his fist.]

Caesar
Oh rare, Massa, Massa.

[Leaps for joy, rubbing his hands.]

Jef.
And now you're free, d'ye mind, if I chuse to swear at you, and break your head, I've a right to it; because d'ye see now, you're my friend and my equal, and may at me again, if you have spunk enough for it. But before, when you were a poor handcuff'd slave, I'd have knock'd my own brains out before I'd have touch'd you; for a true-born Englishman, if he provokes him, damme, he'd knock his best friend's teeth down his throat, -- [to be spoken quick] -- but never lifts his hand against the oppress'd. [Slower.]

Caesar
But, Massa, do Englishmans always quarrel with his friend and fight him?

Jef.
For my part, I never love my friend better than when I'm fighting with him. Damme, if you han't spunk enough to quarrel with an Englishman, he despises you. -- None of your damn'd congees for him -- give him an honest knock o' the head, and he opens his heart to you directly. -- Give me your hand, my boy -- never felt so happy in all my life; and if people did but know the pleasure of doing a generous action, the devil take me if I think there cou'd be an ill natur'd scoundrel in the universe. -- Come along, Caesar, and let us drink to our lasting friendship; and remember you must never suffer any body to abuse your friend -- but -- yourself.

[SCENE, A Card Room discovered.]

[Three Tables on a Side, ranged with Gentlemen and Ladies at Cards. At the upper End of the Stage a Door opens into a Ball-Room, where you see Couples standing cross the Door as dancing; Music playing as at a Distance, not too loud. At the first Table, next the Audience, on one Side, Mrs. Garnish, with her natural brown Complexion, her dark Hair dressed out with a Number of Jewels, and her whole Dress as fine, and overloaded with Finery as possible in the Indian Stile, lolling in her Chair, holding her Cards, and a black Slave standing by her, playing them for her as she speaks them, or points to them; taking up her Tricks, shuffling and taking up the Cards, and dealing for her Another Slave by the side of the other Lady does the same for her. This other Lady to be a Contrast to Mrs. Garnish in every Degree, looking pale and sick, peevish, ill-natured, and unhappy; dressed fine and aukward. Mrs. Garnish all Spirits, Pride, Vulgarity, and Self-consequence. The other Table in front of the opposite Side. A great fat Woman, very brown, sitting full front to the Audience, as fine as can be, but dressed as ridiculously as possible: this is Mrs. Gobble. The other Lady the Colour of Yarico. Miss Bronze dressed with Elegance, in a silver or gold Gauze, Flowers, Jewels, &c. a good Figure, and smart, with black Slaves playing their Cards, as before. Some of the Men elegant and genteel; others brown, sickly Skeletons; and the elderly Men very Fat; as these two Extremes prevail most in India; and in general an awkward, square Manner of holding their Shoulders very high, and stooping their Heads. Some tables with no Blacks attending, to show it is the Distinction of Consequence and Grandeur; and the Blacks who thus attend must be dressed finer and with more Attention than the others, who are seen coming about with Refreshments. The two Tables next to the Ball-room Door purposely neglected, to show they are People to be known Nobodies; where such Folks are generally placed to keep the Wind off from their Betters. The whole Group as much in the Bunbury Stile as possible.]

Mrs. Gar.
I play alone, in diamonds. -- Spadille -- [Black takes it out of her hand of cards, makes up the trick, and places it before his mistress.] -- Manille. -- [Black ditto, as before.] -- Basto. -- Umph! can't have the volle, I presumes; but there's the game dead.

[Throws down the cards; black opposite makes the cards, and her black deals for her.]

1 Gent.
Well, Madam, have you seen our two lovely strangers, the Miss Moretons?

Mrs. Gar.
Seen 'em? yes. -- [Turning up her nose.] -- I play'd alone, with mats; two gold mores, Sir, if you please.

Mrs. Gobble [at second table.]
What's trumps, Pompey? [In a coarse haggish voice.]

Pom.
De hearts, your Lady's honor.

Mrs. Gob.
Ah, hearts! I like that -- I have always so many of 'em. -- My lead -- play a club, Pompey.

2 Gent. [at first table.]
And don't you think the Miss Moretons, Mrs. Garnish, very fine women? particularly the divine Eliza?

Mrs. Gar.
Umph, I don't know, Sir, what you call fine; for I pertest I never seed a more meaner figure in all my born days, not I -- why she hasn't a jewel or a pearl about her whole dress.

Mrs. Gob. [bawling.]
Lord, Mrs. Garnish, why I hear they have receiv'd no company! There is not a man in the rooms can tell me one word what they're like.

Miss Bronze
O Ma'am! Te, he, he, he! Mrs. Tartar was just now telling me the ladies were so squeamish, truly! they wou'd not admit the gentlemen to pay their compliments, for fear it should be thought they came to get husbands. Te, he, he!

[The ladies at all the tables laugh with affected airs.]

Mrs. Gob.
Ho! ho! ho! [vociferously]

Mrs. Gar.
Ha! ha! ha! [loud and vulgarly] Husbands, truly! if the men are all of my mind, Miss Bronze, they'd sarve 'em right to take no notice of 'um. What say you, Mrs. Gobble?

[Musick plays at the top of the stage.]

Second Man at second table
That don't seem to be the case then, Madam, for here they come, surrounded by a croud of them.

[Enter Eliza and Louisa from the Ball Room, dress'd with the utmost Simplicity and Elegance of Taste and Fashion; but their Hair without Powder, in Curls and Ringlets, flowing in Abundance down their Backs to the Bottom of their Waists. Several Gentlemen with them; among the rest, Mr. Supple and the Resident, over dressed, and very hot. As Eliza and Louisa advance, the Ladies all eye them, wink and make all Sorts of rude Signs to one another about them. As Eliza advances towards Mrs. Garnish, she stares up rudely and vulgarly in her Face, and apparently examining her whole Dress and Figure. Eliza, with the utmost Ease and Elegance, sees it, but looks at her with much Nonchalance, and seems in high Spirits. Louisa, all elegant Softness on the other Side, seems disconcerted at their Behavior. During this time Music.]

Eliza
I am glad we have left the ball room; I declare, Resident, there's no dancing a minuet here with any satisfaction; one's as much crouded as at the ball at St. James's on a birth night.

Miss Bronze [in a loud whisper to Mrs. Gobble]
Do you think she was ever there?

Res.
That was owing to your fine dancing, Eliza, and not to the smallness of the room.

Sup.
Oh! such a minuet! [turns to Mrs. Garnish in a lower voice] You never, Mrs. Garnish, saw such dancing in your life.

Mrs. Garn. [loud]
What, so monstrous bad, hey?

Eliza [looking down at Mrs. Garnish with a smile of triumph]
La! Mrs. Garnish, have you forgot me -- I'm sure I shall never forget you -- with your nice plumb cakes, so frosted and decorated; and your pies and your puffs and ices, and creams, all so nice: -- I us'd to buy of you in Oxford road.

[Gents. all burst into a loud laughter.]

Louisa
I wonder we don't see Dormer here, cousin. [Aside to Eliza.]

Eliza
I guess'd you had been looking for him -- nay, never blush -- [turns round carefully to Supple] Pray, Mr. Supple, what's become of your friend Dormer, that he is not amongst us here tonight?

Sup.
Oh! he's a fellow of no taste, I can assure you , Madam -- he hardly ever appears at a ball -- indeed some people doubt whether he knows how to dance; but at present he is gone to a friend of his that is dying.

[Turns upon his heel with much indifference.]

Louisa
Benevolent creature! poor man! some sacrifice, perhaps, to this malignant climate.

Gent.
Gentleman dying, say you? who's that? what young Edwards?

Sup.
Yes, I saw him this morning, and in my opinion, he could not possibly survive four-and-twenty hours; but this is not a subject to entertain ladies -- you must not mind it, Madam. [to Louisa] These things happen every day with us.

Eliza
Edwards! Edwards did you say, Sir? it's a common name -- but -- do you know any -- any thing of his family? [In agitation.]

Sup.
Not I, Madam; indeed I've heard he's a baronet's son -- but I don't believe it; nay, I'm very certain it's no such thing.

Eliza
Wou'd I were so too! not live! four-and-twen -- [faints.]

Louisa
Oh, Mr. Supple, you have kill'd my cousin -- my dear Eliza! [a great fuss around her -- she recovers.]

Eliza
Oh, Louisa!

Sup.
I am very sorry, Madam, but how could I imagine -- 

Louisa
If you would always imagine it necessary to have humanity, Sir, you would not run the risque of shocking other people's feelings. Let me beg our carriage may be call'd.

[They lead Eliza out, and the scene drops. Music again.]

[SCENE, Mr. Northcote's House. Northcote, Dormer, and Edwards discovered.]

North.
Come, come, Edwards, keep up your spirits, and don't give way to these delicate fears of your mistress's constancy; faint heart never won fair lady -- come, here's a bumper to the divine Eliza.

Dor.
Nay, don't let's part two such charming women -- therefore, here's a bumper to both -- Eliza and Louisa, if you please, Mr. Northcote.

North.
With all my heart -- both, then, -- you might have given 'em a glass a piece tho' -- to the charming cousins! Come Edwards, rouze man!

Edw.
Ah! my worthy David Northcote -- your generous heart ever judges by itself -- Eliza was all that's amiable, but -- 

Dor.
Never fear, Edwards; remember true love never doubts.

Edw.
Rather say, it doubts and fears every thing -- and her not answering my last distracted note, sent her just before I sailed from England, gives me cause to dread a change.

North.
Psha! instead of fighting and despairing, wait upon her -- or at least write to her; and Dormer here will delivery your letter, I am certain; especially as that will give him an opportunity, and excuse, for paying his respects to Louisa.

Dor.
On all accounts, most readily; write, write, and she shall have it before she sleeps.

Edw.
You must excuse me, my dear friends; that love, which has hitherto sacrificed every thing, I will not disgrace by an action that must be misconstrued -- no -- tho' banish'd, distress'd, destroy'd for my constancy to her -- yet I would sink unknown, rather than force myself thus upon her notice.

North.
You are low spirited, that's all -- bring us a hooker -- come, smoak a hooker, and drink a glass, and you'll soon perceive Eliza sparkling, all love and beauty.

[Enter Jeffreys, (abruptly, in great agitation)]

Jef.
I beg pardon, gentlemen, for introducing -- but I have been sent to know -- to -- enquire -- shou'd be much oblig'd to you, if you'd tell me which of you three it is -- that is -- dying?

North.
Ha! ha! ha! this is droll enough -- can't you find that out, friend, by our countenances?

Jef.
O Lord! no Sir -- but I beseech you, gentlemen, answer my question as quick as possible.

Edw.
Don't you know the name of the person, my friend, you were sent to enquire about?

Jef.
O lud, Sir, in my hurry I've forgot.

North.
You are mistaken in the house, perhaps?

Jef.
Oh no -- I'm right as to the House, because one of Mrs. Tartar's blacks came with me.

Edw. [in agitation]
Hey -- what -- Mrs. Tartar -- who do you belong to there? [rising.]

Jef.
Dear Sir, why to the Miss Moretons, and there's Miss Eliza, laying almost lifeless all this time; for she was told at the ball, this gentleman [which ever it is of you] was dying.

North.
Was the gentleman's name Edwards, friend?

Jef.
The very same, Sir -- Are you the gentleman;

Edw.
My worthy, dear Eliza! I -- I am Edwards; fly, fly, my friend, and bring me to her.

[Exit with Jeffreys.]

Dor.
Edwards dying! what could such a strange report arise from?

North.
At present no matter. However, let us follow poor Edwards to Mrs. Tartar's; I don't know her, but as the young lady is thus affected, Edwards in his present weak state may stand in need of our assistance.

Dor.
Undoubtedly he will -- besides, as I am already acquainted with her, I can easily introduce you. -- Come, let's make haste, for Edwards is there by this time. [Exeunt.]

[SCENE, a Room at Resident's. Enter Resident and Supple.]

Res.
Is the door fast, Supple? Well, now, what the devil's to be done about this girl? As to that damn'd Edwards, I'll see him at the devil before he shall have her -- but with a fellow of his spirit, and a girl of her fortune, fond of him, as you see she is, to distraction, why, they may take ship and elope for the purpose.

Sup.
Which must be your business to prevent, good Sir.

Res.
Aye, but how? damn it, how?

Sup.
Why, Resident, I have often help'd you out at a dead lift, and I think I have hit it now -- I think I have.

Res.
Ay, there's my good Supple -- what is't, what is't,? If you can but assist me to disappoint this fellow, and get the girl myself -- Damme, ask what you will, have what you will -- I'll deny you nothing.

Sup.
Why I think if we can fairly lay Master Edwards by the heels in our prison, at this time of the year, and in such a devil of a place as you and I know that it is -- and ill, too, as he has been lately, I think we shall have provided for him in less than eight-and-forty hours.

Res.
But upon what pretence?

Sup.
You know it's impossible for a writer to live upon his pay, and without being in dept to the black merchants. I know he is pretty deep with Mazinghi Dowza; send for him, tell him you have particular reasons to insist upon his arresting Edwards -- you know Tyler, our Mayor, and Edwards quarrel'd the other day, so he will directly grant the warrant, and it may be done before to-morrow morning.

Res.
I like it much, I'll about it instantly -- Mazinghi Dowza is without on other business.

Sup.
Is he? egad, then, I'll go and fetch him in directly. [Exit in haste.]

Res.
So! if I can but confine the dog in prison, it may do -- for Eliza can procure no money to release him, but through me. I'll part 'em, I warrant me, and bring her haughty spirit lower -- I'll be reveng'd, however, being refus'd for such a spendthrift puppy, and can pass it off for prudence.

[Re-enter Supple with Mazinghi Dowza.]

Sup.
Come, come in, Mazinghi Dowza! his honor wants you for a particular service, that you must execute for him directly.

Maz.
Me am do all his orders vid submission.

[Puts his hand on his head, and bows his body.]

Res.
Aye, aye, to be sure, you're a discreet, obedient man, Mazinghi, and know your duty. -- What is George Edwards, writer here, indebted to you?

Maz.
Your honor -- me hope -- you no offende me lende de poor fellow little money for his distress.

Res.
Not at all, not at all, Mazinghi, not at all. But I am inform'd he's very deep with you, and it is to serve you that I tell you, if you do not instantly arrest him, you will lose your whole money.

[Mazinghi looks surprized and spreads his fingers.]

Sup.
Aye, it's very true, Mazinghi -- what his worship's goodness tells you -- you'll lose every farthing if you don't secure him in a prison directly; and as his honor has a value for you, he acquaints you with this.

Maz.
Massa Edwards vas always good and civil -- He alvay pay me honest ven he can, I sorry hurt him, good your honor's excellence.

Res.
Do you doubt my intelligence? Sure I ought to know best what's going on here -- an't I Resident? I know what the scoundrel is about, I promise you -- hesitate, therefore, not a moment, but arrest him -- accept of nothing but the money, which I know he can't raise. -- Throw him into prison, and I will support you if complaints are made.

Sup.
Be sure you accept of no bail, nothing of any security whatever, for if you do, you'll lose it all. The Resident knows what he's about, and it's your duty to depend upon him.

Res.
Pshaw man! if you delay you'll lose all your debt; so be gone, and about it directly.

Maz.
Me swear by de great Prophet, it make me heart ach.

[Exit Mazinghi, putting his hand on his head in submission. Resident and Supple exeunt the other side.]

Act IV

Scene 1

[SCENE. Louisa's Apartments. Enter Eliza and Lousa.]

Louisa
Edwards in a prison! good Heavens! For what?

Eliza
A black merchant has imprison'd him for debt! And that wretch, the Resident, won't advance me a shilling to liberate him.

Louisa
What can be done?

Eliza
He has had the cruelty to reproach me with the the affair of Dormer, and thinking we have given him the five thousand pounds, he pretends this as a punishment for the extravagance, as he calls it, of fooling away what wou'd now have been serviceable.

Louisa
A lucky thought! Let's send to the worthy Northcote; as executor of Clairville's will, I dare say his goodness will advance us money for Edwards.

Eliza
I have dispatched Jeffreys for him -- as I knew you wou'd not deny me what this detestable Resident has done!

Louisa
NO, my dear Eliza; nor wou'd the noble Sir Thomas Clairville -- But here comes some intelligence.

[Enter Servant.]

Ser.
Mr. Jeffreys desires me to tell you, Madam, that he cou'd not find Mr. Northcote any were; and as there was no time to be lost, through Caesar's means, he has procured a black merchant who will lend you any sum; and he's now without with a large bag of money ready.

Eliza
Bring him in directly.

[Servant re-enters with Mazinghi.]

Eliza
Sir, I shall feel infinitely oblig'd if you can render me this service, you are inform'd I wish to trouble you about.

Maz.
Iss, Madam; I have bring de money vid me. [Showing the money.]

Eliza
Whatever security you wish, in my power to give you, Sir, I am ready to assure you of.

Maz.
O, Madam, lady of your great fortune me no fear -- His honor de Resident know me vel -- Here is three hundred gold moors -- vil dat do?

Eliza
I really confess myself ignorant of the value of your money; it is to release a worthy young man from prison -- you will oblige me highly in carrying him the money he may want, and my servant here will accompany you -- his name is Edwards.

[Mazinghi starts, trembles, lets the money fall, and lifts ups his hands and eyes.]

Eliza
Heavens! What's the matter? Speak! You distract me!

Louisa
[The other side of him.] Oh, tell us! tell us!

Maz.
It is Mazinghi Dowza what arrest him.

[Putting his hand on his bosom.]

Eliza
You arrest him! Heavens, what shall I do now?

Maz. [Takes up the bag of money]
Take de money and release him -- me no dare.

Eliza [Taking the money with astonishment]
You arrest him, and give me the money to release him! what mean you?

Maz.
Yes, lady, send it to one of you people -- Mr. Norton, he my attorney, manage all dese tings for me -- but you say never me gave you de money -- if you do, me ruin -- doe me de black man, lady, me ave heart. [Puts his hand on his breast, and exit.]

Eliza
Astonishing!

Louisa
He's a charming black soul, however! stay! Here comes Northcote -- no! goodness protect us -- it is Edwards himself!

Eliza [Meeting him at the door.]
My Edwards!

[Enter Edwards.]

Edw.
My dear, my lov'd Eliza! Calm your fear -- I am --  

Eliza
Oh, what generous angel has releas'd you -- I had sent to Northcote -- and he --  

Edw.
But he has been before you -- the worthy man met me at the prison door.

Eliza
Heaven shower blessings on his goodness! How kind! How generous!

Edw.
Oh, my love, you know not that man's worth; he is the blessing of all around himÆ and amongst those benevolent spirits that feel an enthusiasm in softening the calamities of wretches in a prison, David Northcote stands conspicuous, by preventing the wretched from entering one.

Louisa
Jeffreys was telling us some noble actions of this worthy man.

Edw.
His whole life, Louisa, is but a series of them; and where others give rupees, he gives thousands. -- I find, Eliza, it has been through the Resident and Supple, the merchant arrested me, though it must not be mention'd, as it would ruin the poor creature if known he had divulg'd it.

Eliza
Generous creature! then this accounts for the poor black merchant's behavior to us.

Edw.
To you!

Eliza
Yes, you are as much oblig'd to his generous intentions as you are to Northcote; and, I doubt not, it is such examples have produced these effects. -- But, oh! I tremble for your safety.

Edw.
I have the most thorough sense of the kind of interest you take in my misfortunes -- but, in this moment of agitation, I am scarce able to express it; but fear not, my sweet Eliza, Northcote is able to advise and protect you; depend on him, and rest easy -- he imagin'd you might be alarm'd, and begg'd me to escort you and Louisa to his house -- His wife is the worthiest of women and expects you.

Louisa
Ah! do, dear cousin, let us go; let us throw ourselves into such kind protection immediately; for here I'm terrified.

Eliza
Willingly; for I know not how it is, but I never feel easy or happy a moment in this house -- but do you go first, and we will meet you there, as we must pay our compliments first to this Mrs. Tartar -- and, besides, we expect Dormer every minute -- I wonder he is not come.

Edw.
I left him dressing -- he will conduct you, then, to that house, where peace, love, and harmony for ever reign; where affluence is made a blessing, and diffus'd as such to every one who enters -- Oh, here is Dormer. -- [Enter Dormer.] -- Adieu! I put you both under the soldier's protection. [Exit Edwards.]

Eliza
Oh, Mr. Dormer, you strange, unkind man you! here have we been waiting, and have been distress'd and frighten'd out of our wits about Edwards, and you never came near us -- and there I wanted you and your fine sword there, to have gone and cut this Resident's threat for me.

Dor.
My dear, Miss Moreton, I'm sure you will excuse me, when she knows my heart wou'd not let me leave Edwards in distress even to wait on her.

Eliza [A glow of joy rising in her countenance, and giving him her hand.]
Dormer, I cannot thank thee -- words won't do! -- Happy! happy! Edwards, in such a friend as Clairville is.

Dor.
Charming sensibility! -- yet happier far in the virtuous affection of such a woman as his Eliza.

Eliza [Peeping forward at Louisa.]
 -- Or such a woman as Louisa -- hey, Mr. Dormer -- hey, Louisa?

Louisa [Smiling]
My dear, wild girl! with the tears in your eyes, and the smiles on your cheeks! such lively sensibility and spirits sure never were so sweetly contrasted.

Dor.
Rather say so charmingly blended.

Eliza
Come, Dormer, tell me -- I suppose my partiality for Edwards has made a fine feast for scandal here -- come, now, be honest, and tell me what the folks say about it.

Dor.
Why Supple and the women cry shame, and condemn you, whilst all the men adore you.

Eliza
Oh, I don't doubt Supple's being against me, for I know I am a wild blundering creature. Right or wrong, if people will make me dispise them, I must tell them so -- and if they will take my good opinion by assault, as you have done, Dormer, why I can't conceal it; however, let him talk -- for, bless'd with the affection of my Edwards, and the friendship of two such men as yourself, Dormer, and the worthy Northcote, I shall little heed their censures.

Dor.
You do me too much honor, Madam; Northcote has fortune and power, but I have only wishes!

Eliza
If you were talking to the Resident and Supple, who think all merit consists in gold moors and lacks of rupees, fortune might be an object, but to those of hearts and souls, Dormer, it is needless; besides, you can expect only fortune's frowns, if you continue thus obstinately to turn your back upon her smiles -- And, indeed, this affair of Sir Thomas Clairville's must be differently settled.

Dor.
Urge me not, dear Madam, on that point -- my honor is reward sufficient.

Eliza
For all that, we intend laying our heads together with Mr. Northcote.

Dor.
Then I must depend upon the charming gentleness of your cousin, to shield me from your threaten'd machinations, and to promise me she will not vote against me.

Eliza
Indeed she can promise you no such thing! for I know her heart condemns you, though she may fear to tell you so.

Louisa [Smiling]
Really, Mr. Dormer, I think you are too scrupulous; and though I should be sorry to hurt your delicacy, yet you must not be suffered to rise thus above humanity.

Dor.
Such a flattering condemnation, my dear Madam, from your lips, I wou'd not exchange for Sir Thomas Clairville's whole estate!

Eliza
Mighty fine! mighty fine! as the old Resident says -- But, upon my word, we are absolutely rude to Mrs. Northcote.

[Enter Servant.]

Ser.
Madam, the Resident is coming up to wait on you.

Eliza
Is he without?

Ser.
No, Madam; but his carriage is driving up.

Eliza
I suppose he's coming post, about Edwards.

Louisa
And, if you'll permit me, I'll retire till he's gone, for I suppose his business now is principally with you.

Eliza
Oh, you have a mind for a tête-à-tête with Mr. Dormer, I see -- it's well for you my heart's pre-engag'd, for he is a most dangerous creature -- Poor Louisa, ha! ha! -- But hush! here comes the old tyrant, puffing and blowing -- so, away with you. [Exeunt Louisa and Dormer.]

[Enter the Resident at the other Door.]

Res.
So, Madam, you have contriv'd to release this beggarly Edwards, I find! and, if I don't prevent it, I suppose intend throwing away yourself and fortune upon him into the bargain?

Eliza
I certainly came out to India with no other intention, Sir, -- not to sacrifice my youth and peace of mind for pearls and grandeur, but to seek and reward a generous lover.

Res.
Mighty fine, Madam! mighty fine -- but I had too great a regard for your father to see his fortune thrown away upon such a fellow! and must prevent it.

Eliza
But you would literally marry me yourself, Sir, ha! ha! -- I humbly thank you, Sir; [curtseying] but I have too much regard for my good father's daughter, not to prevent also such a preposterous union.

Res.
Preposterous! Madam, I know not what you mean -- I'm sure there's not a lady here who don't envy you the preference I have ridiculously given you -- There's Mrs. Tartar and Miss Bronze -- 

Eliza
And Mrs. Garnish and Mrs. Gobble, ha! ha! ha! -- ridiculous indeed, Sir, to imagine a woman of youth and fortune wou'd sacrifice herself for a paltry ambition she despises. -- I -- I declare I wou'd as soon marry Tippoo Saib.

Res.
Very Pretty, Madam -- very pretty -- but, I fancy, when you find I won't consent to your having any body else -- 

Eliza
That I'll consent to have you, ha! ha! ha! -- No. Resident, from the strange clause in my father's will, I was oblig'd to come to India for my fortune, or have forfeited it -- but I don't remember a word in it about being obliged to marry the executor.

Res.
If your poor father, Madam, was alive to witness, this and to such a friend as I was always to him -- 

Eliza [Holding out her hand to him.]
Resident, don't mistake me -- I honor you, as a friend of my father's -- your kindness to him first help'd to raise his fortune -- an obligation once conferr'd, in my opinion, can never be cancell'd -- Therefore, however your future conduct may distress my heart, you shall find it still remain grateful for those kindnesses you have once conferr'd.

Res.
Why, now, that's pretty of you -- now that's kind -- I love you for that -- upon my soul, Eliza, you -- you might make what you wou'd of me.

Eliza
I don't want to make any thing of you, Sir. -- This man has absolutely a goodness of heart at the bottom, only he knows nothing of the matter. -- [Aside.] -- My good Sir, I wou'd wish to make you my friend, as well as my deceas'd father's.

Res.
Why so I am, and therefore, Eliza, must prevent your throwing yourself away upon this Edwards.

Eliza
Do not let the love of riches, Sir, shut your heart to every generous feeling -- it is for my sake alone Edwards is thus distress'd -- we have been acquainted some years -- his father is proud, rich Baronet, who yet preferr'd sending his son a wanderer abroad, to prevent his marrying a poor destitute (as he thought me) at home. -- O, Sir, think of this -- and shall I now desert him?

Res.
Why -- why, to be sure, if he's a great man's son, and you are likely to be a lady -- why, I can't say, to be sure you -- but still, Eliza, your father always intended you for me.

Eliza
I am very much oblig'd to my father, Sir; but thus stands the case -- I am the mistress of my own actions, if you will not sanction them with your approbation, Sir, I am sorry for it; but as you have no right to control them, I must beg you not to attempt it.

[Enter Louisa.]

Res.
And here is Louisa too, is mistress of her own actions, I suppose, and, I find, is going to throw herself away upon that Dormer.

Louisa
Sir, you surprise me -- why he has never hinted a thought -- Upon my word, Sir, this is so -- I came to tell you that the carriage waits, Eliza.

Res.
What! you are going to Northcote's to dinner, I find; where, I suppose, I shall be cut and carv'd up for your entertainment very prettily.

Eliza
Indeed, Sir, you must know Mr. Northcote disdains to say that behind any one's back wou'd wound their feelings to hear repeated. -- Ah, Sir, were you acquainted with Mr. Northcote more, and Supple less, you wou'd feel yourself happier, and find yourself more respected -- Good morning, Sir; -- we must just pay our respects to Mrs. Tartar before we go.

Res.
Ay, ay, pray do -- give my compliments to her, and tell her I cou'd not stay, for I'm not in a humour to pay respects to her, I tell you honestly. -- [Exeunt Eliza and Louisa.] -- Upon my soul I believe Eliza is right -- for that damn'd Supple grows so arrogant and self sufficient that, lately, instead of being my dependant, egad, he is my master -- and, I don't know, as to Eliza -- hang it -- to lose her myself, and be oblig'd to give her to another -- oh! damn it, that's too much -- that's too much -- and yet there's something so bewitching in the gipsey, that, if she sets about it, I believe she could persuade me to anything; for though she has a devilish deal of spirit, yet it's so unlike that damn'd Madam Tartar's, that I can't help loving her for it. [Exit.]

Act V

Scene 1

[SCENE, discovers Mrs. Tartar lolling on a Sopha. Enter Jeffreys with a Note in his Hand.]

Jeffreys [bowing.]
MADAM, I have brought a note from my young ladies.

Mrs. Tartar
Lord! a note! Cou'd not they have sent a message? I can't take the trouble to read, not I -- there, put it down. [Points to a table.]

Jef.
I was order'd to deliver it into your own hands directly, Madam.

Mrs. Tar.
I'm sure if it requires an answer, I shan't fatigue myself to send one.

Jef.
I don't know, Madam; but those were my orders.

Mrs. Tar.
Really you people from England imagine one has the strength of one's elephants -- continually troubling one thus with such fatigues. -- Well, if this note must be read -- do you read it -- that is, man -- if you can read. [with a contemptuous look.]

Jef. [looking at her meaningly, and making a horrid wry face]
Damn me if the soap-boilers oil don't rise in my throat now. [Aside] Why, yes, Madam -- I can read -- spelling it with a few A-by-self-A's, and I-by-self-I's, mayhap.

Mrs. Tar.
Prithee do, then.

Jef.
Won't you please, Madam, to break the seal? [Offering the note on a waiter.]

Mrs. Tar.
Lord, how troublesome! -- here -- there.
[Takes the note, half breaks the seal, and lets it fall on the ground. Jeffreys picks up the note and reads.]
'The Miss Moreton's compliments to Mrs. Tartar, and as she has so often complain'd of the trouble they are continually giving her, have accepted of Mr. and Mrs. Northcote's kind and pressing invitations to make their house their home, during their stay in India, and shall therefore not trouble Mrs. Tartar any farther.'

Mrs. Tar. [rises in a passion, snatches the note out of his hands]
Begone.

Jef. [bowing]
In the whiff of a tallow candle, Madam. [grinning] Ecod we've made a fine blaze here, and now, as the saying is, I'll e'en run away by the light on't.

[Aside, and exit in haste]

Mrs. Tar.
Was there ever any thing like this? Oh! I could -- and to have expos'd myself thus before their servant! Intolerable! -- and that brute, Supple -- a fine note I've had from him, too. [taking his note from the table.] Yes, yes, you may come and explain, if you please, Sir, but by marrying Louisa you secure her fortune, and then are no longer my dependent -- [puts the note in her pocket.] An ungrateful fellow -- I plac'd him about the Resident, merely to manage and make our own joint advantage of him, by which I have been the making of the wretch -- and now to be left, truly, for such a paltry chit as this is!

[Enter Supple.]

Sup.
Madam, I am quite astonish'd at your note; and so unusual to your good sense.

Mrs. Tar.
Supple, you know you're a hypocrite; but you shou'd also remember you cannot impose upon me! pretend constancy to me, truly, when you want to marry Louisa.

Sup.
Don't I tell you, I don't care three pins for the girl; 'tis her fortune, and that you know, and how can such a poor, unsuspecting, meek-spirited thing, as she is -- 

Mrs. Tar.
And Eliza, too, is a meek-spirited fool, is she? What does you worship's sagacious cunning intend to do with her?

Sup.
Oh she is so manageable, I think the best way is to let her run away with Edwards -- besides that prevents her marrying the Resident.

Mrs. Tar.
A pretty way of preventing it, truly! no; she has insulted me too much for me not to prevent her happiness at any rate.

Sup.
Nay, that's too ungenerous! so that we get quit of her, that's enough.

Mrs. Tar.
The virtuous Mr. Supple! [in contempt] you know you hav'nt a good principle in your whole composition -- and to pretend -- 

Sup.
Well, well, I acknowledge -- but prudence, you know -- prudence shou'd -- 

Mrs. Tar.
Cowardice! cowardice! that's your prudence, Supple. Has'nt it prevented your doing a thousand glorious things I wou'd have had you attempted?

Sup.
Come, come, don't let you and I quarrel -- it is for your interest, as well as mine, I shou'd marry Louisa.

Mrs. Tar.
Lookye, Supple, I won't bear this -- at your peril attempt marrying Louisa -- you know my power to expose you, and by Heavens nothing shall hinder me. [Exit.]

Sup.
There she goes; -- this it is to be in the hand of such a fury -- I must devise some means to rid myself of this slavery; and then the news brought by the ships just arrived, may make it convenient to cut with the Resident -- and so I may still make my fortune in another quarter, and get rid of them both at once. And so now for David Northcote. Oh! I shall make short work with him; he is, or pretends to be, so honest himself, that it is quite out of character for him to suspect other people. [Exit.]

[SCENE, Mr. Northcote's. Enter Resident and Northcote.]

Res.
Upon my soul, Mr. Northcote, this is too much; damn it, Sire, I suppose you depend on your fine character, and so think you may do any thing, Sire. -- I must insist upon the Miss Moreton's returning to Mrs. Tartar directly.

North.
You must excuse me, Mr. Resident; I shall not part with my fair visitors again, I assure you.

Res.
Sir! wha -- what do you mean? Sir -- Sir -- are they not under my protection?

North.
You have only to give them a proper account of their fortunes, for they are their own mistresses in everything else entirely; and as you had plac'd them where they were very disagreeably situated, I have accommodated them in my own house; that's all, Sir.

Res.
That's all, Sir! Damn your composure, Sir. -- This is always your way; meddling with every thing that don't concern you -- I wonder where Supple is -- what do you think he will say to it, Sir?

North.
An insignificant puppy. -- What's such a fellow to me, Sir?

Res.
Lookye, Mr. Northcote, if you continue to go on in this stile, Sir, I must write home; there is no going on thus; for what with your pretended benevolence and generosity, and stuff, Sir, you set the whole settlement in an uproar! There's no governing them -- blacks, whites, Gentoos, and Hindoos, all alike running made after you, and your vagaries, truly.

North.
Yes, Mr. Resident, I feel for human nature, of whatever colour or description; I feel for the name and character of an Englishman. I feel neither the power of gold, prejudice, nor partiality; and where the lives and properties, or even happiness, of others, are concerned, I have ever regarded the impulse of humanity.

[Enter Supple.]

Sup.
Your servant, Gentlemen. [Bowing very gravely.]

Res.
So, Supple, here has this gentleman persuaded the Miss Moretons, truly, to leave Mrs. Tartar's house and reside at his.

Sup.
I am very glad of it, Sir. [Bows.]

Res.
Glad of it! Zounds! What do you mean, Supple? I tell you I am very angry at it.

Sup.
You had better not, Sir; you had better not. -- [Speaking mysteriously; coming nearer to the Resident, and speaking lower.] -- Sir, there is a ship just arrived from England.

Res.
Well, Sir! damn it! and what then? What's a ship just arrived from England to do with pretty Mr. Northcote's here having stole away the Miss Moretons from my protection? Damn it, Supple, I won't put up with it; I insist upon their returning to Mrs. Tartar's -- I insist upon it.

Sup.
You had better not, Sir; indeed you had better not.

Res.
Lookye, Supple, I will be my own master. -- An't I Resident? Why, heydey! an't I Resident, I say? [In a passion.]

Sup. [bowing very gravely and low.]
No, Sir, you are not Resident.

Res.
Heydey! why art mad, Supple! why what's this?

Sup.
I am sorry, Sir, for your sake, to inform you, that the ship just arriv'd has brought out orders for Mr. Northcote to supersede you, Sir, as Resident of this settlement.

Res.
Northcote! Northcote supersede me? he!

[Walks about disturb'd.]

North.
Lookye, Supple, I know of old, a ship seldom arrives but it gives occasion to your inventive faculties. -- But in this you must be cautious; this is too serious a matter young man. [Sternly.]

Sup.
With humble submission, Sir, I hope you will not judge me from mine enemies' misrepresentations. -- What I say is fact. You, sir, are Resident now; and I hope, Sir, as my chief dependance is upon my place, you will not discontinue me, Sir, as secretary to the presidency.

North. [looks at him with contempt, without speaking to him.]
I am sorry this news shou'd have been thus abruptly communicated to you, believe me. -- [To the Resident.] -- I suffer for your feelings as a man -- look upon me as your friend. If this is true, every thing in my power you may command.

Res. [surlily.]
Let me alone; I want none of your officious kindness. -- But as to you, Supple, I didn't expect this -- I didn't expect this from you. [Exit.]

North.
Now I did. -- Go, Sir, [to Supple] follow your old master; if I am Resident, my first action shall be, that of banishing you, Mr. Supple, from my councils.

Sup.
Sir -- Sir -- Sir -- I beg -- I entreat -- 

[Attempting to kneel.]

North.
Begone, Sir. If my masters have thought me worthy this honor they have conferr'd on me. I will never forfeit it by countenancing objects I think unworthy. [Exit.]

Sup.
Very well, Sir; but I may find a time to revenge insulting superiority! and depend on it I shall let slip no opportunity for the purpose.

[Exit.]

[SCENE, an open Walk. Enter Jeffreys and Caesar.]

Caesar
O, Massa! I been seek you -- come vid me -- me tell you such mischief! me hair stand an end.

Jef.
What about Caesar?

Caesar
Oh! bout you sweet ladies! but me faithful heart -- you no give liberty to black dog, Massa! no! me heart good -- me save you ladies vid me life.

Jef.
Life! I would sacrifice a thousand lives to save theirs.

Caesar
So me too; but that Mrs. Tartar -- oh, Mr. Supple tell me such tings! -- oh, Mrs. Tartar von devil! poison de dear young lady.

Jef.
Poison! harkye, Caesar! tell me what you mean; if you save my dear young ladies from any danger, I shall never think I can reward you enough.

Caesar
Reward! me no reward, O Massa. -- You make poor black free, me never forget dat -- me never leave you while me live -- me sarve you faith-ly. [Wipes his eyes.]

Jef.
To have gain'd such an honest, faithful heart, I shall return home with more satisfaction, than if I had got money enough to have gone and despised all my poor relations. -- But poison, say you, Caesar -- stay, here comes Mr. Dormer, you shall tell him the whole business.

[Enter Dormer.]

Dormer [looking at his watch.]
I promis'd, if in time, to return to Mr. Northcote's to dinner.

Jef.
O, Sir!

Caesar
O, Massa!

Dor.
Heydey! What now?

Jef.
O, Sir, Caesar here says something about that hag, Mrs. Tartar, wanting to poison my dear young Ladies -- speak, Caesar; what is it? how is it?

Caesar
O, Massa, Massa! she has poison dem -- she has poison dem sweet ladies. [Wrings his hands.]

Dor.
Heavens forbid! who -- who told you? [In agitation.]

Jef.
Why Mr. Supple told him, he says, Sir; so that I hope it's all a damn'd lie.

Caesar
Massa Supple tell me, Madam Liza dying -- Miss Louisa dead.

Dor.
Dead! Louisa dead! Jeffreys, Caesar, follow me to Mr. Northcote's directly. [Exit.]

Jef.
True or false, this story puts me all in a flutter. -- But come along, Caesar, and if you don't deserve the cap of liberty -- 

Caesar
Though black, Massa!

Jef.
Yes, your face is black, but your heart is as white as a snow-ball. [Exeunt.]

[SCENE, Northcote's House. Northcote, Eliza, Edwards.]

Eliza.
My dear Sir, it is impossible for me to express the joy and heart-felt satisfaction I feel at this unexpected promotion!

North.
I am infinitely oblig'd to you. -- Indeed it is very unexpected.

Edw.
I am rejoic'd at it, my dear Madam, not only as it rewards the nobly virtuous -- stand my friend has ever made against the destructive measures pursued here by our late Resident, -- but that it assures our prosperity, glory and applause as a nation, in discountenancing vice, rapacity and oppression. -- Now I feel proud, and glory I'm an Englishman -- and here comes Dormer, I am sure with the same emotions.

[Enter Dormer, in Distraction.]

Dor.
O, Miss Moreton! are you still alive? -- But my Louisa! -- the agony of my heart's beyond the power of words. -- Deny me not to see her -- for oh! I lov'd her! though nothing but this shocking death should ever have torn the secret from my soul.

Edw.
Compose yourself, my friend; this is -- 

Dor.
Is she not dead? she whom my soul adores? Now -- now, Edwards, without suspicion of a mean, an interested motive, I may distractedly avow the love I bore her.

[Enter Louisa.]

Dor.
Heavens! Louisa safe. -- [Running up to her.] -- O, Madam! forgive my temerity; nothing but the distraction -- 

Louisa
Mr. Dormer! Eliza! what means all this?

Eliza
Why it means that his heart adores you! which nothing wou'd have forc'd his respect for you to have declared, but his hearing (some how or other) we were both dead.
[Louisa turns half aside confused.]
So now, my dear, you may either play off a thousand coquettish resentments before you grant him a pardon, or generously at once confess he has been master of your heart, from the first hour you convers'd with him. -- I only just advise you, cousin, as you ought certainly to act as you think proper.

Louisa
My dear, wild cousin, how is that possible now?

Eliza.
Why, in truth, when two such diffident, delicate lovers meet -- if it was not for such wild friends as myself, you might love on till doomsday without knowing it! therefore, without more ado, or any wry faces -- thus let me join your hands -- and as the old folks always, so -- Heaven bless you both together. -- [Shaking her head and speaking very solemn.] -- There, is not that right, Mr. Northcote?

North. [Laughing]
Perfectly so, thou dear, lively creature!

Edw.
And no fear now, but our new Resident will ratify it.

North.
What, our sweet, blushing Louisa here, and modest Dormer -- Ratify! yes, with the utmost ardour, and happy such a worthy fellow's diffidence has not eclips'd his modest merit.

Edw.
Dormer, I heartily wish you joy!

Dor.
May I dare to hope you will not refuse?

Louisa [Modestly]
It wou'd be ungenerous to retract, Mr. Dormer, what my heart too sensibly approves.

Dor.
Lovely creature! [Kissing her hand]

Eliza.
There's a dear dutiful child. -- [Chucks her under the chin.] -- And pray, Dormer, where did you learn this tragical history of poor Louisa and myself?

Dor.
From poor Jeffreys and Caesar, who had it from Supple, the same authority on which you were inform'd that my friend Edwards was dying.

North.
That fellow's alike in every thing; made up of falsehood. And now, Eliza, I must acquaint you that, by letters from England, our friend Edwards here, has learnt that his father is no more; but convinc'd of his hard treatment of a worthy son, has, by his last will, done every thing to repair his former unkindness.

Eliza.
Well, then, if I cannot reward the disinterested Edwards, I must e'en be content with the affluent Sir George.

Edw.
Every way, my Eliza contrives to be herself.

Eliza.
Do I? I really thought I had contriv'd to be yours.

[Enter Jeffreys.]

Jef. [With his handkerchief wiping his eyes, and bowing.]
I beg pardon for coming in -- but -- but Heavens bless your honor's worship's Resident -- if -- if -- [To Northcote.]

Edw.
Heyday, Jeffreys! what, sad in the midst of joy! what's the matter man?

Jef.
Matter, Sir, -- my dear sweet ladies alive, and Mr. Northcote made Resident! -- the whole place is run wild for joy, Sir -- blacks and whites, masters and slaves, half casts and blue casts, Gentoos and Mussulmen, Hindoos and Bramins, officers and soldiers, sailors and captains -- and if his honor the Resident don't stop them, they won't have an ounce of gunpowder in the whole garrison.

Edw.
Such influence has goodness and benevolence over all ranks and descriptions.

Jef.
They do nothing but call him father -- they keep blessing him and his children; and King George and his children; and their great prophet and his children.

North.
You have an honest heart, Jeffreys -- but recover your spirits -- and as both your ladies are now, I hope, completely happy, I trust you will be so too.

Jef.
I beg pardon, but I always suspected Miss Louisa's blushes whenever I announc'd Mr. Dormer; and I hope, my dear young ladies, as I have always serv'd you faithfully, you won't part with me now.

Eliza.
No, worthy Jeffreys, the only difference we wish to make is, that you consider yourself no longer as a dependant, but an humble friend whose faithful services demand every reward in our power to bestow.

Jef.
My dear, dear mistress, don't talk so; for I never shall recover my spirits -- I have been us'd to laugh and make others laugh all my life long -- so spare me, for I am too happy already.

North.
Come, my worthy friends, let us join the general joy -- a feast of soul, of which, I humbly hope, I may without vanity partake.

Edw.
You may, indeed, Sir -- thus, by the noble exertions of one generous, exalted character, are all our difficulties remov'd -- a whole settlement is made happy, as well as ourselves, by the virtues of David Northcote!

THE END
