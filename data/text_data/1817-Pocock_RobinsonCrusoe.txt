Scene , -- The Island on which Crusoe was wrecked.

Main text

ACT I.

SCENE I.

Represents that part of the Island which Robinson Crusoe calls his Farm. A steep hill occupies a portion of the back of the Scene, in the side of which is the mouth of the Cave, defended in front by an enclosure of Stakes, which having taken root, forms an impenetrable Hedge. On the opposite side, a gentle declivity intersected with trees, at the roots of which, lies the trunk of a Cedar, partly formed into a Canoe, but almost concealed by plants peculiar to the soil. The horizon exhibits the open Sea, and part of the Shore. Near the front, a hollow Tree.
The Curtain rises to Music -- and a Vessel is perceived crossing in the Distance. Friday appears on the Palisade, looks out for his Master, and putting over a ladder, descends, with a basket, from which he produces a bread-cake, a bunch of raisins, and a small bottle of rum, intended for Crusoe ; he throws aside the bushes, and places the Provisions on the bow of the Canoe. (A Dog barks.)

Fri.
Ah! -- da Massa Crusoe.

Music. -- (The Dog runs on, bearing a Bird; Friday takes it, throws it over the Enclosure, and the Dog bounds up the Ladder. Crusoe at the same instant enters, dressed and armed as described in his History. -- He bears the Umbrella, on the top of which is perched the Parrot. -- Friday welcomes Crusoe with extravagant joy).

Cru.
Faithful, affectionate Friday!

Par.
Friday! Friday!

Fri.
Ha! ha! ha! 
(the Parrot flies into the Enclosure. Friday takes off the Umbrella and returns). 

Cru.
Now, Friday, take my gun.

Music. -- (Friday alarmed -- yet fears to disoblige his Master).

Cru.
Courage, courage! -- the thunder, as you call it, hurts only the wicked: why should you be terrified? Would you not use it to defend your Master? Remember, it was with this gun I saved your life, when the ferocious cannibals had doomed you to the stake, the victim of a horrid sacrifice.

Music. -- (Friday intimates his gratitude, and taking the Gun resolutely, carries it with the other articles up the Ladder).

Cru.
What a treasure did heaven bestow, when it made me its humble instrument in saving that poor Indian from destruction! For years no human form had blessed my sight, no voice, except the sad and fearful echo of my own, hadstruck upon my almost palsied ear. Now a fellow being, an intellectual associate, cheers my solitude, and I am content! happy! happy, did I say! -- no, no, my wife! my child -- whom now, if yet he lives, must have reached man's estate. Grant, oh grant he may never know his father's misery, Friday!

Fri.
Massa! -- 
(from the Palisade.) 

Cru.
We must to our daily task.

Music. -- (Crusoe puts aside the branches which conceal the Canoe, and prepares himself for labour).

Cru.
For two years past, a portion of each day has been allotted to complete this almost hopeless labour; but for the assistance of that faithful creature, I had abandoned the attempt. 
(He perceives the bottle, &c.)
Ah, this is well, accustomed to my wants, he anticipates them all. 
Music. -- (The Dog leaps the Palisade, with a Basket, from which Crusoe takes a Hatchet).

Even my poor dog does not neglect his duty: shall I alone despair! No, visions of home and liberty revive and strengthen in my heart.

Music. -- (The Dog obeys the signal of Crusoe , and disappears as he begins to work -- Friday appears on the Hill, and starts at observing some unexpected object).

Fri.
Massa! Massa!

Cru.
What now?

Fri.
Canoes! canoes!

Cru.
Canoes!

Fri.
One, two, tree, -- 
(runs down.) 

Cru.
Ah! perhaps a vessel -- relief! -- No, no; he counted several -- still it may be -- 

Music. -- (Friday has arrived close to his Master in great terror).

Cru.
Why do you tremble?

Music. -- Friday describes the arrival of Indians, by imitating their March; then their purpose, by crossing his hands, as if bound at the wrists like a Prisoner; lastly, their intention, by the action of dispatching the victim and devouring him).

Cru.
Cannibals! a prisoner! a sacrifice? 
(Friday assents to each exclamation). Horrible! may not your terrors have deceived you? 
Music. -- (Friday instantly draws Crusoe aside, and points to the Shore, where three Canoes are seen to pass).

-- Ha! 't is even so -- they land! -- quick, remove every object that may betray us; and above all, secure the dog.

Music , Piano. -- (During which, Crusoe exclaims, "Fear nothing -- conceal yourself in the Canoe, and stir not -- speak not, on your life." -- Friday jumps through the bushes, and looks out, first at his Master, then towards the approaching Indians. -- Crusoe prepares his gun, &c. and as he ascends the ladder, which he draws after him, exclaims "they come! from the heights I shall command them)."

Music , Forte. -- (Pariboo , the Cannibal Chief, enters -- examines the spot, and beckons forward his troop, who having made a circuit of the Stage, place their prisoner Iglou against a stake; and at this instant, Friday exclaims in great agitation, "Father!" The Savages pause in alarm; Pariboo brandishes his Club, and the rest immediately regain confidence. Iglou runs forward, and implores his life -- he is again seized, and as Pariboo advances to dispatch him, Friday throws forward the Flask of Rum. The groupe look round with surprize, till the 

Chief, impatient at the interruption, rushes with savage impetuosity to the sacrifice. Crusoe at this instant fires -- the Indians rush off yelling with apprehension. Pariboo , more resolute, appears to mark the spot from whence the fire proceeded. Crusoe again fires, and the Chief bounds off. Friday springs from his concealment, and raises his Father, who trembles with his face to the earth in the utmost terror. Crusoe arrives in front).

Fri.
Oh Massa, Massa, thunder kill him!

Cru.
Not so -- I fired beyond them, no one is hurt.

Music , Lively. -- (Friday , rejoiced, runs for the Bottle, supports Iglou , and puts it to his mouth).

Cru.
What means this unusual agitation? he must have seen this man before. Friday, do you remember him?

Fri.
Oh Massa! him Iglou, Friday father!

Cru.
His father! Providence I thank thee! even in this solitude I do not live in vain -- I have restored a parent to his offspring! He'll soon recover; -- lead him to the cave, whilst I observe these monsters in their flight, and see that none remain.

Music. -- (Iglou recovers -- starts at the appearance of Crusoe -- Friday explains to him the obligation they are under to his Master. Iglou falls at the feet of Crusoe , Friday on the opposite side, embracing his knees).

Cru.
Happy, happy moment!

Tableau -- Scene closes.

SCENE II.

The entrance of a Wood near the Shore.

Enter Swivel and Nipcheese .

Swiv.
Come, master steward, let out a reef and freshen your way; you lag astern as if you were afraid of being boarded.

Nip.
So I am afraid, and no wonder, considering the cursed scrape I have got into. Plague on the mutiny, I say, instead of saving an honest penny, I may be hanged like a dog, and lose all. Did you say the boatswain had turned the mate ashore?

Swiv.
I did; he would not join us, so we set him adrift without rudder or compass. He straggled off to seek a birth here in the woods; but what argufies that, you are not afraid of a man without arms, are you?

Nip.
No! but he has two devilish long arms, to my certain knowledge, and a couple of thumping fists at the end of them too. I shouldn't like him to settle accounts with me just now.

Swiv.
Well, don't stand palavering here -- 'twas this way we heard the gun.

Nip.
Was it? Then I think we had better go the other 
(moving off). 

Swiv.
What, sheer off!

Nip.
Oh, I'm not ashamed to confess my failings; I always have more satisfaction in escaping danger than meeting it.

Swiv.
Ay, ay, Master Nipcheese, we know you'd rather grub in the bread-room than go aloft.

Nip.
I am glad of it: the worse you know of me, the less chance you'll have of being disappointed. Courage is all very proper in a gunner, but what have I to do with it, that am only shipsteward and super-cargo?

Swiv.
Why, you chicken-hearted ungrateful cur, won't you save all your slops and bread bags by it?

Nip.
That's very true; I shouldn't like to lose my little property.

Swiv.
Then brace up your heart, and be a man.

Nip.
Well, I will, I will; give me your hand; Zooks, I've got some mettle in me, though I dont' brag of it. 
(The Savages yell without). What the devil's that!

Swiv.
Eh! we shall have a squall presently. 
(The Savages shout). 

Nip.
A squall with a vengeance! Zounds! they are savages!

Swiv.
And bearing down upon us!

Nip.
Lord save us, and bless us!

(Runs into the Wood -- the Savages fly across the Stage in confusion; Pariboo the last, who turns to see if he is pursued).

(Nipcheese comes forth to see if there are any others, and suddenly facing Pariboo , is petrified with alarm. -- Swivel appears -- makes a blow at the Chief, who avoids it with agility, and rushes out. -- Nipcheese applies a case-bottle to his lips).

Swiv.
They are all off.

Nip.
Most happy to hear it!

Swiv.
There was a jolly crew of them.

Nip.
Yes, very jolly! I shouldn't like to have improved my acquaintance though with their long legged first lieutenant. -- Never saw such a ferocious looking dog in my days.

Swiv.
They are Caribs, I take it, that cross over from the main, to sacrifice, and so forth.

Nip.
To do what?

Swiv.
Belike you are not up to their rigs.

Nip.
No -- can't say I am.

Swiv.
Why, when they take any of their enemies in battle, d'ye see, they just pitch upon a little quiet spot, like this, and have a feast.

Nip.
A feast! Cannibals! Are you quite sure they won't come back, and give us an invitation?

Swiv.
Not they; they are more frightened than you are. -- See, they are making along shore like a fleet of colliers.

Music. -- (Robinson Crusoe enters, as if tracing the retreat of the Indians, and starts at observing Strangers).

Nip.
They embark! they get aboard their canoes! Wind and tide be with 'em! Phew! bless us all, what an awkward thing it would have been, to have made one at their mess! 
(Drinks). 

(Swivel takes the Bottle).

Cru.
Europeans! Englishmen! Let me be cautious!

(He enters the Wood and watches).

Nip.
But where's the boatswain -- where's Windlass all this time with our prisoners?

Cru.
Prisoners! What can they mean? 
(Apart). 

Swiv.
He'll soon heave in sight; perhaps the woman has been troublesome.

Nip.
I never knew a woman that wasn't, my wife in particular; but is she to be left ashore too?

Swiv.
To be sure; we must have no tell-tales when we run the vessel into a strange port.

Cru.
They are mutineers, pirates!

Swiv.
Besides, what should we get by parting Diego from his mother?

Cru.
Diego! his mother! Merciful powers! Can it be possible?

Swiv.
'Twas the only way of getting rid of our difficulties.

Nip.
Humph! and a pretty sure one of putting an end to theirs. However, she'll care less for the loss of her property, than her disappointment in finding this man -- this what-d'ye-call him, that was lost so many years ago.

Swiv.
Robinson -- 

Nip.
Aye, the same -- Robinson Crusoe. Egad, there's not one wife in a thousand, that would run half the world over, as she has done, in search of an old husband. 
(Scuffle without). 

Swiv.
They make resistance -- See -- 
(Whistle heard). Bear a hand -- that's the boatswain's whistle.

[Exit Swivel . 

Nip.
I know it -- I wish 'twas his last whistle with all my soul! That fellow frightens me more than Mrs. Nipcheese. Oh, that I was safe under her command again! Any torment would be better than such a life of jeopardy.

Wind. (without). 
Does the rascal skulk! Jump upon deck here. 
(Another whistle). 

Nip.
I'm coming! Bull-dog! Oh!

[Exit Nipcheese . 

[Music.]

Cru.
Does my sight mock me! These tears perhaps -- No! 'tis real -- my faithful heart at once acknowledges a kindred soul! It is -- it is my wife! What's to be done? To attack them singly would be madness! I'll regain my habitation by the short path through the wood -- watch in secret the departure of these ruffians, then spring into her arms, and seek no home beyond them.

[Exit to the Wood. 

Music. -- (Diego's voice instantly heard without).

Diego.
Traitor, unhand me!

Wind. (without). 
No words -- bear them along!

(Ines and Diego in chains, are forced on with violence by a party of the Mutineers, Swivel and Nipcheese following -- Windlass , the Boatswain, acting as Commander).

Diego.
Infamous, abandoned wretches! Will not one victim serve? Lost as you are to every sense of honour and of duty, do not add cruelty to insult, do not forget that you are men!

Wind.
'Tis too late to parley, Captain: we have taken our course and must stick to it, -- if its a bad one, that's our look out. You shan't be left destitute, but we are too far on our way now, to ware ship.

Diego.
'Tis not for myself I ask. -- I know too well your guilty project makes compassion for the man you thus have injured, hopeless. -- Behold that female, defenceless and forlorn! If you are not dead to every feeling of humanity -- if the prayers of the unfortunate can reach your hearts, ere it be too late, shew mercy to a woman, and spare, oh, spare and save my mother!

Music. -- (Ines expresses her determination not to be separated from her Son, by appropriate action).

Wind.
No more piping, we've had enough for one spell. Where's the steward?

Nip.
Here!

Wind.
Lead them up the hill, and take off their irons.

Nip.
Me!

Wind.
Yes, its all you are fit for, that I see. We'll bring along the stores. Swivel, you bear him company, and mind the milk-sop doesn't let 'em slip.

Nip.
What! do you doubt my firmness in the cause?

Wind.
No growling -- out with your cheese-toaster, if you are not afraid of the sight on't.

Nip.
Afraid! -- there 
(drawing his Cutlass)
, stony-hearted rascal! how I should like to run him thro' the paunch! 
(Aside). 

Wind.
Now then, off with you, while I collect the stragglers.

Nip.
I must put a good face on it. Come, we can't wait here all day -- 
(with assumed consequence). 

Diego.
Must I submit without a struggle? Wretch! these chains that bind my hands, have not subdued my spirit.

(Nipcheese alarmed).

Nip.
Come, come, Captain, no swaggering -- it won't do with me.

(Ines entreats Diego to be patient).

Diego.
Let me not fall without a blow -- I have strength to make these fetters instruments of vengeance, and thus -- 

[Music.]

(He swings up the Chains to make a blow at Nipcheese , who starts back -- Windlass and the rest spring forward, and arrest the arm of Diego ).

Ines. (Likewise interposing). 
Not so, not so, -- 'till heaven itself deserts us, why should we despair!

Diego.
Well, I submit; but think not, guilty and obdurate men, such crimes will pass unpunished. The prayers of the unfortunate will be heard even in a desert.

Wind.
Away with them. 
[Music.]

[Exeunt Diego, Ines, Swivel , and Nipcheese . 
-- Now, my lads, as I am Captain, it behoves me to make a bit of an oration, just that we may understand each other. -- I'm told there are some aboard, that would rather stick to their old commander, than sail under Jack Windlass and a free flag; but the first that mutinies shall be run up to the yard-arm without mercy, by way of example like to the rest. -- You that are jolly boys, shall share alike in all we have, and all we may have! We'll sink the Banian days -- sleep eight hours instead of four, work little, eat a great deal, and drink a double allowance of grog every Saturday night.

Mut.
Hurra!

Wind.
What, you like that, do you? I thought I should make you shew your grinders at last -- heave along the lumber! With the next tide we'll sail, turn our freight to cash, and then hurra for plunder, and the bold Bucaniers!

(At the close of the following Glee, the Mutineers assist each other with the Stores intended for the Captives, and bear them off).

GLEE and CHORUS.

When the anchor's a-peak, 
And the ship under weigh, 
The wide ocean we'll seek, 
Like a shark for its prey. 
We'll take what we can, boys, 
Wherever we steer; 
Friend or foe, 'tis all one 
To a bold Bucanier. 

Let the signal be heard 
That a sail is in sight; 
Sword and hand we must board, 
If they dare us to fight. 
No danger shall daunt us, 
No odds make us fear, 
We must conquer or die 
Like a bold Bucanier. 
Music continues. -- (As they depart, Pariboo appears expressing rage at the cowardice of his Tribe, who have paddled off in their Canoes, and left him alone on the Island -- He suddenly marks the retreat of the Mutineers, and follows them, with a determination to regain posession of his lost victim, Iglou ).

SCENE III.

Represents that part of the Island which Robinson Crusoe calls his Farm. A steep hill occupies a portion of the back of the Scene, in the side of which is the mouth of the Cave, defended in front by an enclosure of Stakes, which having taken root, forms an impenetrable Hedge. On the opposite side, a gentle declivity intersected with trees, at the roots of which, lies the trunk of a Cedar, partly formed into a Canoe, but almost concealed by plants peculiar to the soil. The horizon exhibits the open Sea, and part of the Shore. Near the front, a hollow Tree.

Robinson Crusoe, Iglou , and Friday discovered.

Cru.
Yes, grateful Indian, gladly I accept your offer; but let me understand it thoroughly; the slightest misconception might be fatal. You tell me 
(addressing Friday )
that in a few hours your father may return with some people of whom he is the Chief. 
(Friday assents -- Iglou expresses impatience at not understanding them).

-- The small canoe in which I survey'd the island, though insufficient for my escape, will serve his purpose in crossing to the main. 
(Friday again assents -- Iglou more impatient).

-- Good, should the wind hold, he and his friends promise to regain this shore by daybreak.

[Music.]

(Friday describes to Iglou the Dawn -- paddling of a Canoe, and the march of their Tribe -- to which Iglou assents with vehemence, enforcing his anxious wishes to serve Crusoe , by appropriate action).

(Friday starts at seeing a strange object; and Iglou at the same time grasps his Tomahawk. -- Crusoe directs his attention towards the point to which Friday signs, who at the some instant exclaims " Massa, se da )."

Cru.
Silence! 'tis one of those strangers whom I told you of -- unless he should perceive us, let him pass -- they may not all be guilty!

Music. -- (The group retire -- Bluff is heard singing without, and enters; a Cudgel under his arm, and a Tobacco-box in his hand).

Bluff. 
"Billy Tailor was a brisk feller, full of mirth and full of glee, 
And his true love he did diskiver to a lady fair and free."
-- Ah, it won't do -- I may sing for my allowance long enough now, before the boatswain pipes to dinner. My heart is sunk five fathom -- many a losing voyage have I made in my time, and weathered many a rough gale; but its damn'd hard to be taken aback at last by a set of swabs -- its all along with Jack Windlass the boatswain, -- I was the man that taught him to hand, reef, and steer, -- and now the dog leaves me like a wreck on a lee-shore, at the mercy of wind and weather, -- Well, 
(taking a quid)
-- it's all one -- "a light heart and a thin pair of bree -- " ey! 
(Seeing Crusoe ). 

Cru.
I'll venture. 
(Advances). 

(Friday and Iglou appear).

Bluff.
Who the devil! -- What cheer, ho! -- Where are you bound, -- from whence came you?

Cru.
Do not shun me, we are fellow sufferers, and should assist each other.

Bluff.
Indeed! well, I have seen strange sights afore now, but smite my timbers -- such a cruiser as you!

Cru.
I am a seaman like yourself, cast on an unknown coast.

Bluff.
Like enough -- your rigging has seen some service -- but, mayhap you take me for a Bucanier -- no such thing, my name's Harry Bluff, as true a heart as ever broke biscuit. I'm a true friend to the Service, and an enemy to all mutineers; -- so, if you are in the picarooning line, you'd best put about, d'ye see, and let me shoot a-head clear of you.

Cru.
I was not mistaken -- we must be friends -- 

Bluff.
Ay, ay! there's two words go to that bargain tho' -- sheer off, or I'll be foul o'your toplights.

Music. -- (The Indians, at the appearance of contention, start forward).

Cru.
Hold! touch him not!

Bluff.
Whew! am I to be run down by a fleet o' small craft? Hark'ee brother, three to one are long odds, but if you, or any of your squadron, offer to board me without provocation, damn me if I don't scuttle some of your nobs before I strike.

Cru.
Do not mistake! tho' you have not seen, you surely must have heard of Crusoe.

Bluff.
What, Robin!

Cru.
The same.

Bluff.
Why, you don't mean to say -- you, ey!

Cru.
Yes, Robinson Crusoe, the father of Diego, the husband of Ines, those unfortunate beings whom an abandoned set of miscreants now drag in chains.

Bluff.
I know! say no more. Ods-heart! I havn't been better pleased -- here lend us a cutlass; if your shipmates are jolly boys, we'll be too strong for 'em yet.

Cru.
That must depend on circumstances: we must run no risks; if they are necessary, I have arms and ammunition in abundance.

Bluff.
Why, have you tho'? Well, an' how are you?

Cru.
Friday! 
(He gives directions to fetch Arms). 

Bluff.
Ecod, I shall sing to some tune yet! "A light heart and a thin pair of -- ." Here, take a bit o' baccy 
(Crusoe declines the offer). Oh, well, as you like.

Cru.
Be careful, they are all charged!

(Iglou and Friday are taking Arms over the Pallisade).

Bluff.
Henceforth we'll cruise in the same latitudes. Hang me if I don't stick by you as long as I can carry a rag of canvass.

Cru.
Quick! these ruffians turned towards the hill, and will soon appear.

(Friday and Iglou run forward with Arms).

Bluff.
Never you mind, I'll soon clear for action. We'll play 'em a salt-water trick yet, mayhap. -- I say, Robin, this loblolly boy of yours seems a hearty sort o' chap! give us your fist, blacky -- there's the hand of a seaman for you, you dog!

(Shakes hands with Friday , who is greatly pleased with his new alliance, till Bluff's hearty gripe changes his countenance, -- his grimace fully evinces the Seaman's strength -- Iglou angry).

Cru.
Now listen to my purpose.

Bluff.
Heave away!

Cru.
My first object is to ensure the safety of Ines and her son -- if they attempt to injure them, we fire!

Bluff.
Ay, a broadside!

Cru.
If they leave their captives unmolested, we must create no alarm, but let them depart.

Bluff.
What! with ship and cargo! and leave us to drive under bare poles, without a mess o' provision aboard?

Cru.
Their numbers must eventually overpower us.

Bluff.
Well, well, you are commanding officer; but if I come athwart Master Windlass in a snug corner, he'd better be in Greenland, that's all!

[Music, piano.]

Cru.
They come!

Bluff.
All hands to quarters then!

(They conceal themselves). 

Ines and Diego enter, in deep dejection, attended by Swivel and Nipcheese .

Nip.
Ah, this appears to me a very pleasant retired sort of a spot, where a man may reflect on the vicissitudes of human life without much fear of interruption. What do you think, Master Gunner, ey?

Swiv.
Ay, ay, this will do; they'll have nobody to overhaul 'em here.

Nip. (Aside). 
Except the savages. Well then, take off their bracelets. I could find in my heart now to do the poor creatures a kindness. I certainly possess a great deal of compassion, but somehow I require so much pity for myself, that I never have any to spare for other people.

Swiv. (who has been employed in taking off their Chains). 
Now then, let's join our messmates.

Nip.
Pho! you know they'll join us presently.

Diego.
A last effort! 
(to his Mother, who by action expresses the uselessness of the attempt). -- One moment.

Nip.
Ey!

Diego.
Hear me; on the score of humanity I perceive you are inexorable; -- not so to your interest, or your personal safety. Think what must be your fate, should justice overtake you.

Nip.
Excuse me, I'd rather not.

Diego.
There are some in the ship who contemplate this crime with detestation and abhorrence; aid them to quell the mutiny, succeed in accomplishing our rescue, I not only guarantee your pardon, but promise, on my oath, to recompense your fidelity, with a sum far greater than you can ever hope to gain by persevering in an act of guilt.

Nip.
Indeed! will you! well, I -- 

Swiv.
What!

Nip.
Oh no -- it -- it's impossible!

Swiv.
Would you bribe us?

Nip.
Ay, would you bribe us? -- I'll get the gunner out of the way, and then sneak back -- pardon and reward! -- Must have an eye to business. 
(Aside). 

Diego.
Speak!

(While Diego directs his attention to Swivel , Nipcheese steals off, and conceals himself in the hollow tree).

Swiv.
Not I; a man can't serve below and aloft at the same time, Captain. I wish you no ill, for my part, but we have hoisted the red flag, and I must stick to it, sink or swim.

[Exit. 

Diego.
'Tis done, and not a hope remains! Oh, mother! we are lost for ever! 
(Sinking into the arms of Ines ). 

(Crusoe advances, restrained by Bluff ).

Cru.
I can resist no longer.

Bluff.
Mind what you're at tho' -- drop gently along-side, or you'll frighten her out of her seven senses. -- You may ha' been a good-looking chap once, but I'll be shot if you're so now.

Cru.
Ines!

(Ines clasps her hands in mingled surprize and alarm -- Diego starts from his abstraction at the exclamation).

Diego.
Ah! what prodigy is this? 
(pause). 

Cru.
Has the unrelenting hand of time so transformed me, that I live not in the memory of her who knew and loved me best? -- In absence still have I blessed thee, Ines!

Ines.
Crusoe!

Cru.
She knows me!

Music. -- (Ines rushes forward to his embrace).

Diego.
Merciful heaven! 'tis he! it is my father. Oh father! to meet you thus -- 

Nip.
What's that? -- an Ourang Outang!

Cru.
I know -- I have heard it all -- our present security must be effected -- hereafter our escape.

Bluff.
Captain!

Diego.
Bluff!

Bluff.
Ay, Captain, here am I, all my timbers repaired, new rigged, and ready for another cruise, as you see. Come, Mistress, don't be downhearted; swab the spray from your bows, and coil up your spirits. Our enemies have more hands, 'tis true, and superior weight o' metal; what then, fortune is not always with the strongest, you know.

Diego.
Worthy fellow! as bold a seaman, and as true as ever set face to weather. 
(To Crusoe ). 

Bluff.
Belay, belay, Captain! I'm no such wonder; bless you, there's many as good a man as I, and amongst these raggamuffins too, if they dared but shew themselves.

Cru.
Indeed! are you assured of that?

Bluff.
I know it. Windlass and the gunner carry it with a high hand to be sure -- but as to that thief, Nipcheese, he'd sooner steal eggs out of the hen-coops, than run his thick skull against a brace o' bullets at any time. But only let me get sight of him! I'll make his head sing and simmer like a pot of chowder.

Nip.
Curse my curiosity! 
(From the Tree). 

Bluff.
Ey!

Diego.
What now?

Bluff.
I thought I heard somebody speak, didn't you?

Diego.
Where? Which way?

Bluff.
Here, close at hand!

Cru.
We must be sudden then. Diego, take this -- 
(Giving a Cutlass). Come, prepare! Friday!

(Friday and Iglou , who have hitherto remained without, run forward -- Ines starts).

Bluff.
Nay, don't be scared! that's Robin's loblolly-boy, and t'other's his powder-monkey, I take it -- both rated on his books as able-bodied men.

Cru.
Now, mark me; unless we can secure their party without alarm, it must not be attempted. An unsuccessful effort would destroy us -- if you hear my signal, spring upon them at the instant, but even then reserve your fire 'till I give the word.

Diego.
Enough! we'll obey precisely.

Cru.
Friday, may I trust you?

Fri. (Nodding assent). 
Me no afraid now, massa.

Cru.
You comprehend. 
(Friday assents). Let all dispose themselves to advantage.

Bluff.
I think that hollow tree would be no bad place. 
(Nipcheese terrified). 

Cru.
'Tis too confined; Friday shall ascend it, and give us notice of their movements -- Ines what would you do? 
(Seeing her armed with an Axe). 

Ines.
I hope nothing; yet if a woman's feeble aid is needful, doubt not my resolution.

Nip.
Why, they're quite an army, I declare.

Music. -- (Nipcheese peeping out, sees the Black, and pops down in dismay. -- Friday mounts the tree. -- As he looks off, the whistle is heard -- All the Parties are still in view. -- Iglou has crossed the Stage with all the circumspection of a Savage, to the foot of the tree, and is anxiously waiting the report of Friday ).

Bluff.
The whistle! d'ye hear?

Cru.
Hush!

(Friday , the instant the whistle is heard, claps his hands, makes a sign to his Master, and rapidly descends).

[Music].

Cru.
Close! close! 
(They all disappear)

Wind. (without). 
Swivel! Nipcheese! Hillioh! 
(Whistle)

Block. (without). 
Hillioh, master steward! gunner! plague on you, where are you?

Enter Windlass , followed by the rest.

Wind.
Where the devil have they stowed themselves? set down the grub!

(The Seamen place the Chest and the Bags at the foot of the tree).

Block.
Look! 
(Seeing the Fetters). They've been safe moored, however; but they've left their silk stockings behind them.

Wind.
Slipped their cables! I don't like this -- who's with the boat?

Block.
Gunwale, and the coxswain.

Wind.
All's well then; Swivel's a true man -- he must have lost his reckoning in this outlandish navigation; but, if that land-shark, Nipcheese, has played false, he shall smart for it -- Hillioh!

Block.
It's no use to hail them here, we should have brought speaking trumpets; our voices are lost among these woods.

Wind.
We must make ourselves heard, or leave 'em to make the best on't; Nipcheese would be no loss, but we can't spare Swivel -- the tide ebbs fast too, and it looks squally. -- I have it, -- fire a volley -- 'twill be answered from the ship -- and if that signal doesn't bring 'em too, nothing will.

Block.
Right!

Wind.
All ready? present! 
(Without placing themselves immediately in rank, they are so disposed as not to injure each other, by pointing to different directions; consequently to the imminent peril of the concealed party).

Steady! don't level so low, 'twill deaden the report. -- In the air, lads! fire!

Cru.
Upon 'em! -- 

(Music).

(The instant the discharge takes place, the concealed party rush forward. Windlass encounters Crusoe , and the rest are variously engaged -- Nipcheese escapes in the confusion -- Ines rescues her Husband, who has been disarmed, while Bluff , having disabled his antagonist, rushes forward, and with his Cudgel fells the Seaman, who instantly encounters Crusoe when he recovers his Sword -- Friday at the same moment over-powering Windlass. -- Diego and Iglou likewise subdue their antagonists, and the Curtain falls on the Tableau.

END OF ACT I.

ACT II.

SCENE I.

The Stage represents the Interior of Crusoe's Cave.

Opposite the Spectator is the Entrance. To the right, near the front, is a Door which leads to a Subterraneous Passage, made of a flat stone, and adapted to the Cavity, so as to escape notice until it is opened. There are various shelves, upon which are goods and utensils taken from the Wreck; likewise other articles which the industry of Crusoe has fabricated for his use and convenience. An open Chest stands to the right. Two Chairs, covered with skins, and a rude Table covered with the same -- the whole practicable -- a Lamp hangs at the side -- Diego eagerly examining the different objects -- Crusoe and Ines in conversation.

Cru.
Yes, Ines, such were the reverses which befel a man, once possessed of every luxury, every comfort that domestic happiness could give -- 'tis past, forgotten! -- this joyful meeting has repaid me all. I was the only being that escaped with life; and the desire to preserve it, aiding the resources of my mind, with time and patience, I constructed this dwelling.

Diego.
But, your arms, your stores?

Cru.
They were taken from the wreck of the vessel, which for three months held together. During that period, I recovered those articles, valuable beyond all calculation! -- beneath that table is a cell, where I concealed my powder, and matters of equal importance.

Diego.
Where do you repose?

Cru.
There! 
(Throws open the secret Door). 

Diego.
In that dungeon, so dark and damp?

Cru.
It possessed a quality to me more serviceable than light or warmth -- safety! it has two separate outlets -- one in the wood close without the cave, the other among the rocks upon the beach. I trembled lest the Caribs should in time discover my abode, and resolved, in case of a surprize, to make retreat certain. Accident completed what the united efforts of Friday and myself scarcely could accomplish. We discovered an excavation leading to the spot where I was first washed on shore. But, come, we must prepare for our departure. While we have time, let us secure those things that now may be of service.

Music. -- (Goes into the Dormitory -- Ines following, stops at the entrance Retreats in alarm, and falls on the neck of Diego ).

Diego
So fearless in danger, -- yet so apprehensive in safety. -- Dismiss these idle terrors, they will unnerve my father. The villains are confined in the outer cave, and guarded by the faithful Friday.

Cru.
Now then, we have nothing to detain us. 
(Returning from the Cell, and giving a Casket to Diego ). 

Diego.
A casket! 
(Ines recognizes it). 

Cru.
You well remember it, Ines -- 't is the same I took from San Salvador when last we parted.

(Diego places the Casket on the Table).

Diego.
What have you there?

Cru.
The journal of my exile! a treasure far more useful to my fellow creatures than that splendid dross, -- it tells them never to despair, -- it teaches them to place their trust in that Power, who can befriend the wretched outcast, when the whole world abandons him. 
(Ines places the Book in the Chest). 

Diego.
By this pass we shall avoid all chance of observation from the stragglers. -- Bluff has doubtless secured the boat, and must be waiting for us with impatience. But Friday -- your faithful Friday!

Cru.
He shall not be forgotten. 
(Surveying the Cave). Farewell, scenes of my sorrows and my sufferings, a long, a last farewell! 
(Pressing away a tear). 

Bluff. (without). 
Hillioh!

Diego.
Hark! some one calls!

Bluff. (without). 
Hillioh, Captain!

Cru.
'Tis the seaman.

Diego.
Bluff! what can have happened! Holloa! here! 
(Runs to the back). 

Music. -- (Ines shews alarm).

Cru.
Be patient, all may be well. 
(Bluff advances). 

Bluff.
Well, this is the queerest navigation I ever sailed. -- I were obliged to throw out signal for a pilot, Captain, or I should never have found my way into such a blind port as this.

Diego.
Your news?

Bluff.
Bad enough -- might ha' been worse. -- I've fallen in with the enemy's cruisers, and was obliged to scud.

(Ines expresses anxiety).

Cru.
But the boat!

Diego.
Is it in our possession?

Bluff.
No, it was sunk in action.

Diego.
Sunk! destroyed! 
(Ines clasps her hands in despair). 

Bluff.
Nay, don't strike your colours yet, it isn't so bad as all that comes to. 
(To Ines ). 

Diego.
Explain!

Cru.
Speak!

Bluff.
It's soon said: according to orders, I made the best of my way along shore, and got a-board the boat snug enough, when, who should heave in sight but Gunwale and the coxswain. -- Come, thinks I, I can manage a couple of you, and prepared my small arms accordingly.

Diego.
Quick! the event!

Bluff.
All on a sudden, in the wake o'them I saw two more; what's to be done now, says I! (A man is but a man, you know), down I lay -- howsomever, they soon spied me, and began cracking away -- being pretty dark, I didn't value their shot a pinch of oakum, but knowing it was all up with us if they got possession of the boat, with one blow I stove a plank in her bottom -- she filled -- I jumped ashore -- dash'd through their squadron, kept up a running fight, and here I am.

Cru.
'Twas well done!

Diego.
May they not recover the boat?

Bluff.
No -- but we can, and repair it too -- there's comfort for you -- at low-water she'll be high and dry again.

Cru.
Did they pursue you far?

Bluff.
Yes, close under the land here.

Cru.
So near! 
(Ines alarmed). 

Diego.
Who were the two last?

Bluff.
The gunner, Swivel, and that old bumboat-woman, Nipcheese; he was upset in the scuffle directly, and there I left him sprawling like a frog in a fit.

Cru.
Let the worst happen then, we can match them.

Bluff.
Match 'em! Why, bless you, Nipcheese has no more heart in him than a rotten ratline, and as to the coxswain, I've strong notion my last fire carried away some of his rigging. I saw him make an awkward sort of a bow, like, at parting, as much as to say, thank you, that will do, I've got quite enough.

Music. -- (The Dog barks -- the Groupe in consternation -- Friday rushes in terror-struck).

Cru.
What now!

Fri.
Oh, Massa, Massa, white man free!

Cru.
Escaped!

Bluff.
What, broke from their lashings? This looks bad.

Cru.
Those who pursued you, have discovered and released the rest.

Diego.
Then all is lost!

Bluff.
No such thing! 
(To Ines ). We may surmount the futtock shrouds of despair yet; you shall never founder till old Bluff's a sheer hulk. 
(During this, Friday explains the accident to Crusoe ). 

Cru.
Separated! in search of our concealment? Then we may still avoid them -- Should we be driven to extremity, remember the secret pass. 
(Diego throws it open). Collect more ammunition, quick! 
(To Friday ). You, Diego, hasten to the shore and kindle a fire on the rock -- this will afford the means. 
(Giving him a tinder-box). 'Twill direct the friendly Caribs to the spot we most may need them.

Diego.
It shall be done, -- but, my mother -- 

Cru.
Must remain here under the charge of Friday, while myself and Bluff endeavour to decoy our enemies further from the cave. If we can elude their vigilance 'till Iglou and his party land, all danger ceases. Away, Diego! and remember my instructions.

Music. -- (During this, Friday has drawn the Table aside, and opens a Trap beneath it, from whence he brings Cartridges, and distributes them rapidly. -- Ines clings to her Son, who with difficulty quits her embrace, and enters the secret pass. -- Crusoe , greatly distrest at her situation, directs Friday to protect her, and beckoning to the Seaman, leaves the Cave. -- Friday has closed the Trap, replaced the Table, and extinguished the Lamp -- Ines sinks on a part of the Rock -- the Moon, sinking over the Trees without, gives a sombre light. -- Nipcheese appears at the entrance).

Nip.
So I have got out of harm's way at last -- sneaked out o'the battle gloriously -- yes, I shall be snug here -- What a night have I passed! buffetted by one party, and abused by the other! They set no more value on my precious life, than they would on a mouldy biscuit. 
(Friday perceives Nipcheese the instant he speaks, and conceals himself as the other advances, by means of the Table -- Nipcheese takes out his Bottle).

-- This is the only friend I have in the world, but I've drawn upon him for comfort so often, I fear he won't honour my drafts much longer. 
(Drinks. -- Ines has revived, and observes Nipcheese . -- She looks round the Cave for Friday , but does not perceive him).

-- I should never keep my spirits up, without 

pouring spirits down. -- What's here? a table, and a box -- ey! why, this must be the very place the boatswain ordered us to seek! It is, the cave of Crusoe! Lord! I hope he's not at home! I suppose the firing, just now, alarmed the whole family! It did me, I know. -- I wonder what's in this box, it's monstrous heavy -- as I'm an honest man, here's the key fasten'd to it, with a bit of rope-yarn. 
(Opening the box) 
Money! yes, by my curiosity, gold! and -- a case of jewels! precious stones! -- Now, if I don't take care of it, Windlass and the rest will commit a robbery, and call it lawful spoil! -- they shan't say I'm greedy. -- I'll manage it as most prize-agents do -- pocket the best part, for the trouble of dividing the rest.

(During this speech Ines directs her attention to the treasure, and prepares to address Nipcheese , when the exclamation of Friday arrests her.)

Fri. (unable to contain his rage). 
-- He dam rogue!

[Music.]

Nip.
Ey! 
(Slapping down the lid of the Box in terror). Who's there? Who's that spoke?

Swiv. (without). 
'Twas I, Swivel! Where are you? 
(Music ceases). 

Nip.
I'm just in time 
(Secures the Case). Its the gunner -- he always calls me rogue -- so I'm satisfied. 
(Turns and sees Ines , who is seeking concealment). Ines! Fire and faggots! If she tells those fellows, I'm a dead man!

Swivel and Gunwale enter.

Swiv.
Well, have you found out where he swings his hammock?

Nip.
Yes, in this cave, and there stands the mistress.

Swiv.
His wife!

Nip.
I'm glad they're come, I should never have managed that she dragon by myself.

Swiv.
Where is the Captain?

Ines.
Safe! safe on board the vessel.

Swiv.
Escaped to the ship! impossible! And Crusoe -- is he with him?

Ines.
No -- he vowed never to quit this spot, and insisted on my remaining with him. -- Swear to restore me to Diego's arms, at once you gain his favour and a mine of wealth. If I can deceive them, we may yet be saved! 
(Aside). 

Nip.
Convey you to your son! I thought 'twas your only wish to recover your old husband. 
(She dissents, and shews the Casket). 

Swi.
Money!

Gun.
Gold!

Nip. (Aside). 
I'm glad she says nothing about the jewels.

(The Seamen, who have stood in amaze, are additionally astonished when they open the Box).

Ines. (Looking round). 
More! All -- all shall be yours.

Nip. (Aside). 
Zounds! is there more?

Gunw.
Swivel?

Swiv.
What's the Boatswain to us?

Nip.
Every man for himself, say I -- 
(Taking the Casket). What say you?

Gunw.
But how to get her off? The boat's sunk.

Nip.
Wait in the wood 'till day-break.

Swiv.
And then hail the vessel -- so we can.

Ines.
Are you resolved?

Swiv.
We'll do it.

Nip.
Never fear us, we'll do any thing for money.

(Friday by accident lets fall the lid of the Chest -- Ines screams).

Nip.
What the deuce was that? Why do you look so terrified?

Swiv.
Be quick, our comrades will come alongside else.

(Ines points to the Table, &c. -- Friday , who has attended to the foregoing, is behind the Chest).

Nip.
A cell, an excavation! I understand.

(Ines has put back the Table, and now raised the Trap -- Gunwale descends, and Swivel stands a step down).

Swiv.
I say, messmates, what a cargo of riches!

Nip.
Fair play, my lads, below! We share alike, remember.

Swiv.
Look you there's no foul play aloft; you remain and keep guard, here -- 

Nip.
I will. 
(Ines , greatly distressed, looks again for aid, and catches the eye of Friday ).

-- How devilish dark it is. 
(Looking down). 
Is it very deep? I'll not trust the rascals -- they'll be helping themselves -- holloa!

(Nipcheese having descended a step or two, Friday springs saddenly forward, and drives him down the Trap. -- Ines drops on her knee in thankfulness, and turning, catches the hand of Friday , who is now greatly delighted. -- At this moment, Bluff rushes in pale and disordered).

[Music during the foregoing].

Bluff.
All's lost! you must not remain here an instant!

Ines.
My husband! speak!

Bluff.
I can't -- I'm choaked! -- he is taken by that devil, Windlass.

(Friday in an agony of grief -- Ines in despair).

Bluff. (Dragging her off). 
Come! come!

Ines.
Never! -- for Crusoe I have lived -- with him I'll die!

Wind. (Without). 
This way! Force him along!

Cru. (Without). 
Oh, Ines! oh my wife!

Music. -- (At the voice of her Husband, Ines breaks away from Bluff (who enters the secret pass) and rushes into the arms of Crusoe , who, secured by Windlass and another, has forced his way to the Cave: they are dragged off together. Nipcheese ascends from the Cell. Friday seizes him by the collar, and encounters Gunwale -- during the combat Swivel ascends -- Nipcheese is tumbled into the Chest by Friday ; he disables Swivel , who flies -- the combat continues. Nipcheese watches his advantage, and escapes. -- Friday is disarmed, and contrives to avoid the blows aimed at him till he gains a pistol, with which he shoots the Mutineer , and jumping on the Chest, looks down on the body in a mingled emotion of alarm and joy).

SCENE II.

Part of the Cedar Wood, and one of the Outlets from the Subterraneous Pass -- the Cannibal Chief, Pariboo , who has been left on the Island, here appears skulking about on the watch for Crusoe . Hearing a step within the Cave, he retires, with expressions of vengeance. -- Bluff 

comes forth hastily, having missed the Avenue that leads to the shore, pauses, and listens.

Bluff.
All's quiet, there's no pursuit! -- O, that I had but saved her! -- that I had but died with her, rather than bear such heavy tidings to her son! it will be his turn next -- Poor souls! they've had a stormy passage thro' the voyage of life! -- -- Ey! how's this? -- 
(Looking round)
I see no rock, no shore -- yet 'twas by that passage that the Captain -- hark! I hear them! -- 
(voices without). They are quarrelling amongst themselves! there's hope in that! -- 
(Noise repeated). Yes! they are divided one against the other. -- I must find the Captain any how. -- Under Providence, there may be a chance yet!

[Exit Bluff . 

Music. -- (The Mutineers enter, in cabal with Windlass .)

Wind.
I say, yes, nothing else will keep him quiet; but if you will save their lives, don't blame me if you should chance to lose your own.

Swiv.
It's the only way to preserve them. If we hurt a hair of their heads, the Captain will not spare a man of us.

Block.
What signifies the Captain, or Bluff either, now we can muster a dozen hands! But why han't the crew sent off another boat?

Wind.
Ey! I never thought o'that -- our people must ha' been overpowered, and if these dogs suspect it -- 
(Apart). 

Block.
What say you?

Wind.
How were they to know we had lost our own boat? let the worst come to pass, we have a snug birth here, well stored and victualled, and with his tools we could build a lugger in a month.

Swiv.
Belike we could! but it's a bad look out to lose the freight tho' 
(Mutineers murmur). 

Wind.
No! there's a way to save it; the day breaks -- in half an hour, we may see a grey horse a mile, as the saying is.

Mut.
What then?

Wind.
While I and Swivel make a signal from the rock, do you follow with Crusoe and his wife. -- Diego, if he should be on board, will then see them at our mercy, and will not dare set sail to leave us.

Mut.
That's right!

Wind.
Away, lads! be lively!

Mut.
Huzza! bear a hand!

Wind.
Heugh! you grumbling scoundrels!

[Music.]

[Exeunt Windlass and Swivel , on one side -- Mutineers in confusion and haste, on the other. 

SCENE III.

Represents that part of the Coast on which Crusoe was wrecked -- To the left, in the front, is a Pole, on which is affixed this Inscription, "I was cast on this Island, September 30th, 1659, Robinson Crusoe " -- On this Pole are perceived the notches, by which means he counted the time -- To the left, in the distance, a steep Rock, with an ascent to it, overlooking the Sea -- the whole of the right occupied with a Wood of Cedar Trees, which is in the form of an amphitheatre -- On the right, Rocks under the Wood, and a chasm distinguishes the opening to the Secret Pass -- In the centre, the Sea -- The whole sombre, extensive, and wildly picturesque -- It is early dawn, which gradually increases.

Music. -- (Diego discovered increasing the Fire, which flames on the summit of the Rock).

Diego.
I watch in vain! in vain I feed the beacon's fires; no sound, no signal is returned that speaks approaching aid, or cheers expiring hope. These Indians, on whom we have relied, dreading a conflict so unequal, have possibly detained their more courageous chief, and all again is doubt, suspense, and agony! 
(Music -- he descends). What can have happened? The early dawn already shews the dark grey line of the horizon, yet my father comes not, or my friend; they surely must be safe -- had the secret passage been discovered, ere now these wretches had explored it. At intervals, confused and distant sounds have broke upon the stillness of the night, and thro' this vaulted chasm, accents of supplication and complaint have seem'd to float upon the wailing blast -- Again! hark! it is not fancy! Oh, mother! mother!

Bluff. (Entering in the distance to the right). 
So, I'm right at last. 
(Diego starts and listens).

-- Diego! Captain!

Diego.
Bluff! my friend! then all is well. I must have been deceived.

Bluff.
Hush! not so loud! Have the Indians appeared -- have they arrived?

Diego.
No! since midnight I have watched incessantly; but tell me -- 

Bluff.
We must extinguish that fire.

Diego.
Why so? You know its purpose?

Bluff.
I do, but -- it -- it may be a guide for foes, as well as friends.

Diego.
Foes! my heart misgives me, I dread to ask -- 

Bluff.
You shall know all, but first -- 

Diego.
Silence!

(Friday has appeared at the mouth of the Cave).

Fri.
Massa Diego!

Bluff.
'Tis Friday!

Music. -- (Diego has run eagerly to Friday , who meets him with great delight, till enquiries are made, when his expression instantly varies, and he describes in action the situation of Ines and Crusoe ).

Bluff. (Observing them). 
I say, Blackee! what do you turn up the white of your eyes, and keep bailing out bad luck there for? Be alive, my lad, and smother the flame, quick!

Diego.
They are lost, inevitably lost! nothing now can save them.

Bluff.
Nothing! you forget, you forget -- courage, Captain! do not shame your mother! she has a heart as feeling as your own, but as fearless as your father's! remember how he was saved, how wonderfully found. Never believe the hand that preserved him then, means to desert him now -- perhaps at this very moment -- 

(The low and lengthened note of a Conch is heard. -- The groupe become fixed -- at the second sound the Canoes appear).

Fri. (With the most extravagant gestures, exclaims) 
'Tis Iglou! 'tis de Carib! 
(he runs up the Rock and extinguishes the Fire). 

Bluff.
I said it, I was sure on't!

Diego.
Yes, I see -- I acknowledge the innocent are never friendless.

Music. -- (The dawn has so far advanced, as to make all the objects distinct. The March of the friendly Indians is heard. Iglou lands, gives 

a signal of command to the rest, and is welcomed by Friday and Diego . Iglou points to his Warriors, and intimates their intention to stand by him and Crusoe to the last).

The Indians Enter in March -- Bluff looking at them with surprize and satisfaction.

Bluff.
Ecod! they are a set of clean made fellows. I say, Captain, what a pity 'tis they can't abide the smell of gunpowder -- if they could but stand fire, we should be a match for a score of such fellows as Windlass.

Diego has received the explanation of Iglou's plan from Friday ).

Diego.
Friday informs me, that Iglou has selected from his tribe, those who, by a slight intercourse with Europeans, have become acquainted with our arms, and the manner of using them.

Bluff.
Ay, ay!

Diego.
Our method of attack and defence, they meet by stratagems peculiar to themselves, as snares, ambush, and sudden assault.

Bluff.
Why, they are at it now.

Diego.
Observe!

Music. -- (Friday has been explaining to the Savages the use of his Pistols, persuading them not to be alarmed, &c. -- Iglou has ordered his people to the Wood, and they are seen lopping down branches with their Tomahawks, each man returning with a bough -- Iglou , by a signal, causes the Indians to crouch behind their branches, and not one appears in sight. -- Iglou in front, with his ear to the ground).

Diego.
Some one approaches! 'tis a single step -- we must act as occasion justifies.

Music -- (Bluff retires to the Chasm, from which he observes what passes; Diego, Friday , and Iglou retire to the upper end).

Enter Nipcheese , tipsy.

Nip.
Oh dear, oh dear! when will all my troubles end? Every thing I do, makes bad, worse. I thought to dispel fear by drinking, instead of that, it makes me see danger double. 
(The Indians move slowly, and form a line behind Nipcheese , still concealed by the branches).

-- I can't move an inch without meeting some accommodating body, ready and willing to blow out my brains -- it's really very unpleasant. First, I was beset with savages, then nearly buried alive, and presently I suppose, I shall -- ey! Now whether my head runs round, or those trees have run round, rot me if I can tell. I have it -- this Island is enchanted! I shouldn't be surprized if I am transformed as Crusoe is, and look for all the world like an old he -goat on his hinder legs -- Lord! what will Mrs. Nipcheese say then! However, I'll hide my jewels in the crannies of that rock, till its time to embark, and then -- 
(He approaches the Chasm, Bluff starts forward with a Pistol presented).

Another pistol! don't! don't fire, you'll oblige me exceedingly.

Bluff.
Another word, and 'tis your last!

(Nipcheese makes an effort to get away -- the Indians shout and drop their branches -- Nipcheese falls on his knees -- Diego and Friday starting forward at the same instant, to prevent an attach from Iglou ).

Diego.
Tell me instantly the plans of your accomplices.

Nip.
I'll tell you every thing, give you every thing, only save me from being roasted, and made a meal of! 
(holding out the Case of Jewels, which Friday snatches). 

Diego.
Where is my mother? Where is Ines and Crusoe?

Nip.
In the cave -- they'll be here presently.

Diego.
And Windlass?

Nip.
He'll be here too -- you may kill him and welcome!

Diego.
What's his intent?

Nip.
To make somebody swim to the ship, and tell a parcel of lies to the crew -- I was afraid he'd pitch upon me, and having no stomach for water, got out of his way, and tumbled into yours.

Bluff.
The ship! well thought on -- I'll be before hand with them. They have warped her close in shore, and I can paddle one of the canoes there in the turning of a capstan.

Diego.
Right!

Bluff.
Give us a shove off, Friday.

(He gets into Iglou's Canoe, and Friday pushes it off).

Diego.
Now aid us to protect my father, assist in preserving my mother, and you will save yourself.

Nip.
I will, I will, as I'm a sinner, and hope to be saved.

Diego.
Do not think we shall lose sight of you; not a word you utter will escape us. If I observe the least attempt at treachery, tho' I perish in the act, that moment is your last!

Nip.
You needn't doubt me; I always have an eye to business, and make it a rule to stick by the strongest.

Diego.
When they have brought hither, and secured their prisoners, decoy them from the spot, as you may best be able 
(retires). 

[Music.]

(Iglou forms the Indians into separate concealed clusters, resembling clumps of Bushes -- Diego takes a station near the side).

Fri.
See da! poor Massa Crusoe come!

The Party enter, with Crusoe and Ines bound.

Wind.
Now then, belay them to those trees, while the gunner hails the vessel from the rock. 
(He sees Nipcheese ). So, you land-lubber, where have you been skulking?

Nip.
Skulking! I've been waiting for you: 'twas no use to hail the ship before it was light, so I amused myself by reading an almanack.

Wind.
What, read in the dark, you drunken scoundrel!

Nip.
I beg your pardon, I've been sober this five minutes, and the book that I was examining is in large text hand -- only look! 
(Pointing to the inscription). 

Wind.
It's a rum sort o'log book, sure enough! Messmates! What's that writing at the top?

Nip.
That's what I can't make out.

(The Seamen have secured Crusoe and Ines -- Swivel ascends the Rock, and makes signal to the Ship -- at the call of Windlass the Mutineers come forward -- Iglou appears, and attempts to cut the cords that confine the Captives -- at this moment the Parrot perches on the stump to 

which Crusoe is bound, and cries, " Poor Robin, poor Robin Crusoe )."

Wind.
Ey! what are you at now! 
(Turning on Nipcheese ). 

Nip.
Me! I never opened my lips -- this Island is haunted -- and -- 

Wind.
Haunted! pshaw! -- none of your nonsense.

(Diego shews himself, and makes Crusoe and Ines understand his intention).

Block.
This is the way he kept his reckoning, I suppose!

Wind.
We know that well enough; but look aloft, tell us what's on the cross-trees.

Block.
"I came, to this, i -- s -- land -- 

Wind.
Island, you dunce! -- "I came to this Island," isn't that it? 
(To Nipcheese ). 

Nip.
Yes, that's plain enough. I don't think you'll leave it though in a hurry.

(Here the Parrot flies off, and in passing Friday , who is on the watch near Ines , cries, " Friday, poor Friday )."

Wind.
Again! you blackguard -- 

Nip.
Zounds, don't be so savage -- you won't believe me -- but if this place isn't bewitched, I'm a Dutchman.

(The Mutineers take a survey of the place, and examine their Captives).

Wind.
All right! all's safe! -- Go on. 
(Advancing again to the Inscription). What do all these pot-hooks and hangers stand for?

Nip.
Let me try again -- I can see much clearer than I could just now. -- "I came to this Island September 30th, 1659, Robinson Crusoe."

Wind.
He has been on this station a plaguy long time then.

Nip.
Yes, but I think he has quitted his station by this time.

(During this, the Indians have encompassed the Captives -- and slowly moved off with them -- still concealed by the boughs).

Swiv. (From the Rock). 
They return the signal, -- I see the launch and jolly-boat putting off.

Wind.
That's well -- be ready. -- Ey! 'sdeath and fire! where are the prisoners?

All.
The prisoners!

Nip.
The prisoners! bless my soul, they are gone, sure enough! And the trees are gone too!

Wind.
Pursue instantly!

Swiv.
Keep your ground! I see them, they are protected by a swarm of Indians!

Wind.
Indians! pshaw! a single shot will disperse a thousand -- follow me!

Nip.
Follow! Hurra, my boys -- hurra! 
Music. -- (Windlass , and the whole of the Mutineers rush out).

-- I'll remain here as a corps de reserve. 
(Shouting without). 
There's work! there's chopping and lopping! If they fire at random, they'll be sure to hit me! By the lord, they're coming back again! 
(He runs off). 

Music. -- (The Indians are seen flying before the Mutineers, and pass off. -- Robinson Crusoe and Ines enter, followed by Windlass -- they combat -- Crusoe , exhausted, is disarmed -- Ines arrests the blow of Windlass , and a struggle ensues -- Friday enters, and encounters the Boatswain at the instant Pariboo starts forward to revenge himself on Crusoe -- Pariboo is met by 

Iglou -- they engage each other with Daggers, while Friday drives off Windlass , &c. During this, Crusoe and Ines have been secured by Mutineers, and borne off. -- Pariboo overcomes Iglou -- Friday runs on at the moment, and throws himself before his Father. -- Iglou recovers the Dagger which has been wrested from him, and the combat is renewed with ferocity. -- Pariboo is disarmed, but instantly snatches a Tomahawk from Iglou , and is at the point of dispatching him, when Friday returns with the Dog, who rushes upon the hostile Chief, and carries off the Weapon. -- Pariboo flies, is pursued, and driven from the Rock into the Sea by Iglou .

Diego, Ines , and Crusoe , brought in secured -- Windlass and the Mutineers fronting them).

Diego.
Perfidious villain!

Wind.
You sought our lives! prepare now to lose your own. Comrades, present -- fire!

Mut.
No, no, no.

Swiv.
Leave them to their fate, but spare their lives.

Wind.
What! refuse! then my own hand shall -- 
(Levelling a Pistol). 

Music. -- (The Indians rush on, headed by Iglou , and make a defence with their Shields before the Captives -- Friday at the same moment dashing the Pistol from the hand of Windlass ).

Wind.
Now will you assist -- 

Mut.
Ay, ay. 
(The Indians shout). 

(The Mutineers attack, and at the same instant the Crew of the Vessel, headed by Bluff , rush forward, cheering).

Bluff.
Now, you damned dogs, we have you. 
(He strikes down the Boatswain, and the Mutineers drop their arms). Joy, Captain, joy! I told you how 'twould be -- the crew are true to a man, and the ship's your own again.

Diego.
Secure those miscreants till their fate shall be determined.

Music. -- (They form a Procession, and depart -- Iglou, Friday , and the Indians marching in the front and rear).

SCENE IV.

A Picturesque View of the sea shore from beneath a shed built by Crusoe . -- The Music still continues -- Iglou and his Troop march in, and halt at the back of the Scene.

Enter Diego and Ines , in great joy, followed by Robinson Crusoe between Iglou and Friday .

Cru.
Courageous Chief! and you, my ever faithful Friday! -- well have you repaid my service; amply have you proved your gratitude! -- In saving you, I have preserved the lives of those, far dearer than my own. 
(Embracing Ines ). Now then collect those memorials I selected, and prepare for my departure; your last act of duty is at length arrived. 
Music. -- (Friday starts, trembles, and shews signs of grief).

I understand -- but, remember, I have found a wife and son, you a father! 
Music . -- (Friday intimates his affection to his Father, but his wish to follow Crusoe ).

-- His heart is with his parent, -- his service with his master! -- 

(Friday turns from one to the other, and at length drops at the feet of Crusoe ).

-- Be happy then, we will never part! -- Iglou, you lose him but for a time, -- I shall again revisit and reward my benefactors!

Enter Bluff , and the Mutineers , guarded by the Crew.

Bluff.
Come, my lads, don't look so blank. -- After all, it is but hanging, you know, and that can't happen twice in your lives! -- They're as mute as stock fish! pretty fellows for Mutineers, an't you? -- I say, Captain, speak a word to 'em.

Cru.
Let me pronounce 
(To Diego ). Wretched and misguided men, live! -- and if you can, live peaceably, learn to appreciate that first of blessings -- Liberty! -- by enduring in this Island, the fate to which you had devoted others -- I leave it you, far different than I found it -- you will possess every means of shelter, comfort, and protection! -- Endeavour to deserve them, and you may yet be happy!

Enter Nipcheese , as the Mutineers go off.

Bluff.
Ah, Master Nipcheese, are you above board yet?

Nip.
Yes I am, to my very great astonishment. O, Captain! I hope you'll not leave me in this horrible island. Those rascals forced me into the plot, and if you'll take me once more into favour, you shall find me as honest a steward as ever had charge of a bread-room.

Bluff.
He's chip in porridge, Captain, neither good nor harm: I'll answer for him, he'll never get into this scrape willingly.

Diego.
Well, I forgive him.

Nip.
Do you? Bless you! I shall be a man of business again. O, Mr. Friday, there are all your brothers and sisters arrived, come, I suppose, in search of your honour'd papa. Never saw so large a family in my life!

Cru.
Away, Friday, and receive them. Collect the memorials I wish to preserve, and, then, all hands aboard.

[Music.]

(The various articles belonging to Crusoe , affixed to branches, are borne by the Indians, still under the direction of Iglou . His Quadrant, Compass, Telescope, Journal, &c. Friday carries the Umbrella, with the Parrot perched on it -- a kind of Car formed by the Indians, with a canopy of leaves, is mounted by Crusoe with his Dog; Diego and Ines at each side, and the whole pass off in Procession).

The following Round sung during the Procession:

Give the word, 
Let's aboard! 
Every heart be jolly! 
Danger o'er, 
Sigh no more, 
Banish melancholy! 

Man the boat, 
Once afloat, 
Let the can go round, boys; 
Toddy swig, 
Dance a jig, 
We are homeward bound, boys! 

Give the word, 
&c. &c. 

SCENE THE LAST.

[Music].

The Ship lying at anchor near the Shore, surrounded with Canoes -- On the left the exterior of the Shed, overhung by Rocks. -- Crusoe, Diego, Ines , and Friday , discovered seated near the side -- the Stage filled by the Friendly Indians -- Iglou prostrates himself to Crusoe , and presents a branch of the Palm, intimating his desire that Crusoe should witness a Festival in honour of their friendly compact.
A Ballet is then performed by three Quadroon Girls decorated with Feathers, &c. -- Iglou and the rest occasionally bearing part -- Antikoo next appears, and performs various feats of activity peculiar to the Caribs; at the conclusion, a Gun is fired from the Vessel -- the Party rise, take leave of Iglou , and depart. -- The Groupe prostrate themselves towards the Vessel at the report of the Gun -- the Boat is seen rowing to the Ship -- the Sails are set, and the distant voices of the Crew singing the Round, are heard as on board the Vessel, and sinking on the ear, as the receding Vessel diminishes to the sight. -- Tableau.

THE END.
