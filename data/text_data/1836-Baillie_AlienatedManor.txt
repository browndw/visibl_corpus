ACT I.

SCENE I.

-- A Wood, with a View of Charville 's House in the background, seen through the Trees.

Enter Crafton, who immediately stops short, as if looking earnestly at something off the Stage.

CRAFTON.
Who can it be? Ho! paper and pencil in hand; and the broad-brimmed hat, too, with its green lining; -- I heard he was with them. Fit crow for such a rookery!

Enter Sir Level Clump.

Your servant, Sir Level Clump; I wish you good morning.

SIR LEVEL.
Good morning, Mr. Crafton; I am delighted to see you. Do you often, in your morning rambles, trespass thus far on your neighbour's premises?

CRAFTON.
I trespass not at present, I hope, being directly on my way to pay my compliments to Mr. Charville on this happy occasion.

SIR LEVEL.
Right, Mr. Crafton; you are above any little resentment for the extravagant demand with which he so ungraciously met your late reasonable offer regarding this manor. I know all about it; and the very unfair advantage which the late Mr. Charville took of your uncle's distresses to get possession of it, -- I know all about it. Mr. Charville is my friend and employer, but I am too candid not to feel and to perceive: indeed he was wrong -- much in the wrong, in that matter.

CRAFTON.
And in other matters too, perhaps. But one must keep up some intercourse with the world as it is; the grass would grow on my threshold, were I to confine my visits to the immaculate. You are come down, I presume, to improve the pleasure grounds. He means upon his marriage to have every thing in the modern taste.

SIR LEVEL.
And shall have it, if I can do any thing; but he is so conceited of his own notions, so suspicious, he will trust nobody but by halves.

CRAFTON.
What; not trust Sir Level Clump implicitly in matters of taste! Conceited indeed! -- But what are your own ideas, Sir? Have you surveyed these woods, with all their winding paths, and ferny dells, and dark covert nooks, and tangled thickets? I am, perhaps, too partial to the ancient possessions of my forefathers, but this place seems to me full of sylvan beauty.

SIR LEVEL (tardily).
Yes, -- O yes.

CRAFTON.
Don't you think so?

SIR LEVEL.
Assuredly: it is at least practicable ground. If you saw my plan, you would be astonished at what may be made of it. A few hundred pounds spent in clearing away the underwood, and cutting out that heavy mass of forest trees into separate groups, would give it a very elegant, tasteful, parkish appearance.

CRAFTON.
Cut out the mass of forest trees into separate groups! I should be astonished indeed.

SIR LEVEL.
Ay, ay! knew you would. Lightness, variety, and plan -- these are the grand principles; there is nothing like these. For you know very well, my dear Sir, if there be no plan, there is no meaning in what you do; ergo, no taste; and if there be no taste, it is all one as if there were no plan.

CRAFTON.
Not exactly, Sir Level.

SIR LEVEL.
Nay, you don't exactly comprehend me. You'll catch it by and by, when I show you my sketch. Why, these woods, as they now are, compared to what they will be when the plan is completed, are as a rude, untamed clown to a gentleman.

CRAFTON.
Say, rather, a savage chief to a posture-master. But you have been in the North lately, Sir Level. What progress is taste making in Lochaber?

SIR LEVEL.
O lud, lud! totally impracticable! What could I do for them there?

CRAFTON.
I'm sure I can't pretend to say; but you did attempt something, I suppose.

SIR LEVEL (shrugging up his shoulders).
Ay; the Laird of Glenvorluch, who is lately returned from Calcutta, with a large fortune at command, did indeed take me over his estate and put a carte blanche into my hands; but in vain. There was a burn (as they call it) running past the house, with water enough in it to have beautified the domains of a prince; but with such an impetuous, angry, perverse sprite of a stream, spade or shovel never contended. It would neither serpentine, sweep, nor expand in any direction, but as it pleased its own self.

CRAFTON.
And having no plan, Sir Level, it would, of course, have no taste.

SIR LEVEL.
Ah! sad discouraging work there for improvers!

CRAFTON.
Was there nothing to be done?

SIR LEVEL.
I could, no doubt, have collected its stores in the dell beneath, and made as fine a sheet of artificial water as heart could desire; but what purpose could this have answered with a lake fronting the house, in which you might have floated half the small craft of the British navy?

CRAFTON.
A perverse circumstance, indeed.

SIR LEVEL.
In short, all that I could do was to remove some rough woody knolls that intervened, and, instead of a partial view of the lake, open it entirely to the mansion, as a grand, unbroken whole. A hundred sturdy Highlanders, with wheelbarrows and mattocks, made it, in a short time, a very handsome, smooth, gradual slope, that would not have disgraced the finest park in Middlesex. This piece of service I did for him.

CRAFTON.
And had you done as much for me, Sir Level, I should have acquitted you from all further trouble.

SIR LEVEL.
Ay; you are a reasonable man, Mr. Crafton. Why, what could I have done better for such an obstinate place?

CRAFTON.
Nothing that I know of, unless -- 

SIR LEVEL.
Unless what? Pray let me have your idea. Successful as I have generally been, I hope I still bear my faculties too meekly not to be willing to profit by a friendly hint from a person of discernment. -- Unless what, my dear Sir?

CRAFTON.
Unless you had let it alone altogether.

SIR LEVEL.
O no, no, no! that was impossible. The Laird had a lady, -- a young bride, too; -- she was new, the house was new, the furniture was new, and the grounds also were to be made suitable: I was obliged to operate upon it.

CRAFTON.
A hard necessity.

SIR LEVEL.
However, since no better could be, they have my plan hanging in the library, to show what the place ought to be, if it will not; and this must even vindicate their reputation for taste to all the strangers and travellers who may visit the house of Glenvorluch.

CRAFTON.
Very good, Sir Level; the lady must be satisfied with that. -- But pray let us talk of another new-married lady. How do you like Mrs. Charville? Is she handsome?

SIR LEVEL.
She is very fond of my plan.

CRAFTON.
O, no doubt; and this would have been a decided answer, had I inquired after her mental perfections. But being a plain country squire, and pretending to little refinement, I simply inquire if she is handsome.

SIR LEVEL.
I believe people do think her so, though the rules of art are against her.

CRAFTON.
Never mind the rules! -- I beg pardon. She is handome then; and gay, I suppose.

SIR LEVEL.
Yes, yes: she is too gay; perhaps the world will say thoughtless; but I must still think there is a fund of good sense at bottom. She really perceived the beauties of it with great quickness, and took to it wonderfully.

CRAFTON.
Took to what?

SIR LEVEL.
To my plan.

CRAFTON.
O very true! how could I lose sight of that? And how will a gay thoughtless wife suit a man of Charville's disposition? He is very suspicious, you say.

SIR LEVEL.
They jar a little, as other married folks sometimes do; but if they put my plan into execution, it will occupy them more pleasantly -- for a time at least.

CRAFTON.
If separating the trees will unite them, there is sense in the plan, and its taste is, of course, unquestionable. -- And how do you like Charville's sister, who is so much admired -- the gentle Mary?

SIR LEVEL.
She is gentle enough; but she has no quickness, no perceptions, no brains at all.

CRAFTON.
Poor girl; I fear she has not wit enough to comprehend the plan. -- But here comes my nephew; he is going with me to the mansion.

Enter Sir Robert Freemantle.

Come, Freemantle; I have waited for you here some time, and am indebted to this worthy gentleman for not finding it tedious. Let me present Sir Robert Freemantle to you, Sir Level.

FREEMANTLE.
Sir Level Clump, I presume. We shall have a paradise about us presently, were we but worthy to enjoy it.

SIR LEVEL.
You do me honour, Sir Robert. You have a pretty place in the West, I am told, though the park is somewhat in disorder: but, no doubt you mean to improve it.

FREEMANTLE.
I must improve my corn-fields in the first place, to get money for other improvements.

SIR LEVEL.
The readier and more common method, now-a-days, is to cut down the wood on one part of the ground, to pay for beautifying the other.

FREEMANTLE.
A good device, Sir Level; but my worthy mother likes the old woods as they are; and you might as well bring her own grey head to the block, as lift an axe against any veteran oak on the estate.

SIR LEVEL.
Ah! those old people, with their prejudices, are the bane to all taste and improvement. -- Good morning; I see Mr. Smitchenstault in search of me.

CRAFTON.
Is that the German philosopher we have heard of?

SIR LEVEL.
Yes; so he calls himself. I only pretend to make these grounds visibly beautiful; he will demonstrate, forsooth, that they become at the same time philosophically so. Poor man! though mighty clever in his way, he is altogether occupied with his own notions; and to indulge him a little, I have promised to meet him in the further part of the wood. Have you a mind for a lecture?

CRAFTON.
Not at present, my good Sir; excuse us.

SIR LEVEL.
Good morning to you.

[Exit. 

FREEMANTLE (running after him).
I have a mind for the lecture, though.
(Checking himself and returning.)
No, no; we will go to our visit: she may possibly be there; she is probably there; she is certainly there: the brightness of the sunshine, the playful fanning of the wind, the quick beating of my heart tells me so. Uncle, are you going? You are in a deep reverie, methinks.

CRAFTON (aside, without attending to him).
His suspicions, her thoughtlessness, -- the idea fastens itself upon me strangely.

FREEMANTLE.
Ha! speaking to yourself, Sir! What is it that fastens upon you?

CRAFTON.
A thought for your good too.

SIR ROBERT.
Pray let me have it then, for very few such thoughts have any immediate communication with my own brain.

CRAFTON.
Charville has got a pretty wife, whom he loves to a folly.

FREEMANTLE.
And a pretty sister, too, whom he loves but moderately; yet some other good person might be found, who would be willing to make up that deficiency.

CRAFTON.
I understand thee well enough. But she has no fortune unless she marry with her brother's consent; and his robbing (I must call it so) thy poor simple cousin at the gaming-table shows plainly how much he loves money.

FREEMANTLE.
Nay, nay! Since I have seen the sister, I would forget that unhappy transaction entirely.

CRAFTON.
I only mention it now to show his disposition; and surely thou art poor enough to justify his refusal of thy suit to his sister.

FREEMANTLE.
I have never made any suit to her.

CRAFTON.
I know thou hast not; but if thou shouldst, how wouldst thou relish a flat denial from his formal importance? Therefore, if thou hast any thing of this kind in thy head, I would counsel thee to begin with paying thy particular attentions to his wife, who will afterwards plead thy cause with her husband. -- Come, come; it is a very good thought; let us speak of it as we go.

FREEMANTLE.
But not so loud; we may be overheard.

CRAFTON.
Very true; give me thine arm.

[Exeunt. 

SCENE II.

Charville 's House; a Saloon opening into the Garden.

Enter Mr. and Mrs. Charville, speaking as they enter.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
No, no! I can't wear them so of a morning, my dear Charles: positively you sha'n't make such a witch of me.
(Pushing him gently away as he endeavours to stick flowers amongst her hair.) 

CHARVILLE.
And art thou not a witch, little Harry? with spells enough about thee for any man's perdition, if thou wert not at the same time a good -- a very good little witch, mine own little Harry! Do wear them so; they look pretty.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
They look awkward, and affected, and silly; I can't endure them. Why will you be so teasing?

CHARVILLE.
And are my expressions of attachment become teasing? A cold indifferent husband, then, would please you better. You reject the simple offering of a devoted heart: as my fondness increases, yours, alas! declines.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Come, come; don't look so grave! I'll stick those foolish roses into my hair, if you will, though I am sure they are only fit for a holiday nosegay.

CHARVILLE.
I gathered them, Love.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
And I am sorry, Love, you had not the wit to gather better. They are such as a village school-mistress would strew in her drawer to sweeten her kerchiefs and aprons. They are too full blown for the flower-pot on her window. But never mind; I'll wear them.

CHARVILLE.
I knew you would, for all your saucy words, mine own little Harry: and I'll tell thee what I'll do in return for all thy sweet condescension.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
And what may that be, I wonder?

CHARVILLE.
You objected to my going to Middlemoor this morning.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
No, I did not.

CHARVILLE.
Nay, but you did. I read it in your eyes, gentle Harry. But now I set that journey aside: I will not leave thee a week; not half a week; no, not a day.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
O what a tide of goodness flows upon me now! I shall be drowned therewith. -- Not a day! Do you think I wish to have you always by my side? No, my dear Charles: go from home when you please; and when you return you will bring your sister and me all the news, and let us know how the world is moving. All the married folks, I know, are sometimes separated.

CHARVILLE.
And are they as happy as you would wish to be?

MRS. CHARVILLE.
They are happy enough, I suppose.

CHARVILLE.
I suppose; suppose. The cold, formal, miserable word! I hate the very sound of it. -- I may go from home, then, as often as I please. My absence, I suppose, would be no interruption to your happiness?

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Your occasional absence, perhaps, might increase it. The most wretched pair of all my acquaintance is the only one always together.

CHARVILLE.
Who are they, pray?

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Lady Bloom and her jealous husband. The odious man! She can't stir, but he moves too, like her shadow. She can't whisper to a friend, nor examine a picture or gem with an old cognoscenti, but he must thrust his nose between them. -- But how is it now? You are as grave as a judge, and twisting off the heads of those very flowers, too, that have occasioned all this commotion. How is it with you now?

CHARVILLE.
You take part against the husband very eagerly, I perceive.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Not very eagerly; but I hate a man who is so selfish that he must engross his wife's attention entirely. What do you think of the matter?

CHARVILLE.
It is indifferent to you what I think of it; I am no longer your care -- your only care.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Did I ever tell you that you were? God forbid I should be so uncharitable, so narrow, so confined! I have cared for some people in the world besides you, and I have told you so.

CHARVILLE.
Yes, Madam; I should have remembered how long Henry Devonford disputed with me the prize of your heart: you favoured us both.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
True, Charles; but where would have been the merit of preferring you, had I cared for nobody else? If I did show some favour to him, it was you whom I married.

CHARVILLE.
Very true, very true! It was me whom you married, married, -- married.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Nay, foolish man! If you will stride about the room so, let us give something of a figure to it. We are too grave for a rigadoon, so we had better make it a minuet.
(Holding out her gown, and always facing him, as he turns away, with so much coaxing good humour, that he is at last overcome, and clasps her in his arms.) 

CHARVILLE.
My dear, dear Harriet! you treat me like a fool, but I must bear with it. I know thou lovest me better than thou professest to do.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
O not a whit!

CHARVILLE.
Nay, but thou dost. I know it.
(Putting his hand fondly on hers.) 

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Indeed you know a great deal that nobody else does. You study deeply for it; you are fond of occult learning.

Enter a Servant announcing Company.

CHARVILLE.
And we must be pestered with such interruptions.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Don't fret; I like to see new faces.

Enter Crafton and Sir R. Freemantle.

CRAFTON.
I am happy, Mr. Charville, to offer you my hearty congratulations, and to have the honour of paying my respects to this lady.

CHARVILLE.
I thank you, Sir. I am happy to have the honour of seeing you and Sir Robert Freemantle in my house; -- and Mrs. Charville too -- we are both glad to have that honour.

MRS. CHARVILLE (after making a formal courtesy to Crafton, and then turning to Freemantle.

And must I do my ceremonies to you too?
(Makes a very affected stiff courtesy, and then holding out her hand to him with great vivacity.)
My old friend and playfellow, I am delighted to see you. So unexpected! Do you belong to these parts?

FREEMANTLE.
No; but my good fortune makes me a temporary resident at present.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
It is good fortune to us all. Is it not Charles? He is brother to my friend Charlotte.
(Charville bows gravely.)
And how does dear Charlotte? is she near us too?

FREEMANTLE.
No; she is in Shropshire.

CRAFTON.
I could not prevail upon my niece to come to me at this time.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
O but she will come, when she knows that I am here: do write to her: it is so long since we met. Do tell me about her, Sir Robert; I have many things to ask.
(Drawing him aside.) 

CRAFTON (to CHARVILLE ).
What a charming frank disposition! -- a most charming woman! You are a happy man, Charville, and a bold one too, after the dealings you have had with this wicked world, to become responsible for such a treasure. But you will tell me she is all perfection, and I will believe it.

CHARVILLE.
Nay, good Sir, if you are disposed to think well of my choice, I had better trust to that for doing her justice.

CRAFTON.
Ay, ay; I understand this grave restraint: you have applied the point of ridicule to many a poor Benedict; and when it comes to your own turn, you shrink from it. You are but a new recruit in this service of matrimony, and still belong to the awkward division.

CHARVILLE (smiling faintly).
Perhaps so. It is a pleasant morning: did you come by -- 
(Here Mrs. Charville and Freemantle pass from the bottom of the Stage into the garden.)
-- by the common?

CRAFTON.
Why, that lies miles off on the other side, you know.

CHARVILLE.
True; I mean the garden.

CRAFTON.
When you are kind enough to give me a key to it, I may come that way.

CHARVILLE.
No, no! I mean the woods.

CRAFTON.
You have named my way -- my favourite way, at last. But I fear it will not long be so; for Sir Level Clump pronounces it to be practicable ground, and that is a death-warrant to nature and simplicity.

CHARVILLE.
Nature and simplicity are very antiquated personages; and Mr. Crafton is particularly kind in taking any interest in the latter, who has assuredly no kindred claim to his protection.

CRAFTON.
And is it for the same reason that you would drive her from yours? -- But let us both befriend her on more liberal principles: I shall be proud at all times to follow your good example.

CHARVILLE.
You expect to keep up with me on some of the easy-pacing virtues.

CRAFTON.
I don't know; even so mounted, you may run me harder than I like. But I may strive to do it, were it only out of spite.

CHARVILLE.
I'll trust you for that.

CRAFTON.
Do so, by all means: trust me or any body for any thing, if you can, and you will cultivate a disposition of mind that is good for man in every condition, particularly in the married state. Under another name, you know, it is one of the cardinal virtues.

Enter Smitchenstault.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
O you talk of de vertues cardinalls, de great, de grand, de sublime vertues; dat be de ting, de one only ting.

CRAFTON.
Mr. Smitchenstault, I presume.
(Bowing.) 

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Yes, yes; hear you me: my name is Smitchenstault. Hear you me. De sublime vertue is de grand, de only vertue. I prove you dis. -- Now we shall say, here is de good-tempered man; he not quarel, he not fret, he disturb no body. Very well; let him live de next door to me: but what all dat mean? -- O, dat he is de good-tempered man. Den dere is de industrious man, hear you me, de industrious man; he don't love idle, he work, he toil, he do every ting dat be to do; -- very well, all dat very well: let him build my house, let him make my shoe, let him -- 

Charville (who has been all this while watching with his eyes Mrs. Charville and Sir R. Freemantle, as they walked to and fro in the garden, seeing him now take a letter from his pocket, calls out, off his guard).
A letter!
(Moves towards the garden.) 

SMITCHENSTAULT (pulling him back).
Letter! I say no letter: I say make my shoe. O, let him make -- let him do all dat; dis be well too. And dere be de sober man: he not love wine; wine make him ill; and he have always de great commendations, -- O, he be de sober man! But, I say, now hear you me -- 

CRAFTON.
We do, Mr. Smitchenstault; and no disparagement to your argument, it is a virtue of necessity.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
No, he don't hear. -- 
(To Charville.)
What you always look dere for?
(Turning round himself.)
O, de lady is in de garden!

CHARVILLE.
Shall we join her, Mr. Smitchenstault? She is fond of your reasoning.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
No, no! She love de flowers and frivolities. I say, hear you me. I say, let him make my shoe.

CRAFTON.
But you had got beyond that, my good Sir.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
O, very well den, you understand. -- But of what value is all that piggling, niggling, -- you call little thing piggling, niggling?

CRAFTON.
Sometimes we do, perhaps.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Very well: what is it, I say, but de piggling, niggling driblets of virtue? But de grand, de sublime, is in what you call -- not de heart -- 
(Striking his breast.)
-- not de heart.

CRAFTON.
Stomach?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
No, no! -- Soul -- 
(Striking his breast with greater energy.)
-- ay, de soul, dere be de sublime vertue. My sentiment, my entusiasm, my love for my friend do flame here; what tough in my rage I do cut his troat?

CRAFTON.
That were but a trifle. But suffer me to transpose the matter, and make the sublimity of sentiment to belong to your friend, and the throat to yourself.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Pardon, pardon! you do turn upon me de very vulgar reply. Observe well de turn of my argument. Actions be noting: it is de high soaring of de soul. -- 
(To Charville.)
But you don't attend; you don't look at me.

CRAFTON.
Pardon him, Sir; his eyes follow a still more agreeable object. -- Shall we join the party in the garden, Charville?

CHARVILLE.
O no! 'pon my soul, I was looking at that window frame; the ideot of a carpenter has bungled it abominably.

CRAFTON.
I see no fault in it. But you are difficult; Mr. Smitchenstault's piggling virtues are not in favour this morning. Good day.

CHARVILLE.
Ha, ha, ha! 'Pon my life, I am in the best humour imaginable. You will not go without taking leave of Mrs. Charville.

CRAFTON.
I am a person of no ceremony.

CHARVILLE.
But your nephew.

CRAFTON.
He will walk home when he likes it: I take no charge of him. -- Good day, Mr. Smitchenstault.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
O! but you have not hear where de sense of my argument lies.

CRAFTON.
I have not indeed.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
But you must, tough. I go wid you.
(Taking him by the arm, and speaking busily as they go off.)
De soul is de sublime energy; it is de subtile matter, de, &c. &c. &c.

[Exeunt Crafton and Smitchenstault. 

CHARVILLE (now looking without restraint to Mrs. Charville and Freemantle in the garden).
Very good friends, truly, with their letters and their confidences. That coquettish animation too: they must have some merry joke to laugh thus. No, hang it! 'tis their own damned pleasure in being together.
(Runs to them in the garden, and the scene closes.) 

ACT II.

SCENE I.

-- Mrs. Charville 's Dressing Room. She is discovered with Mary, sitting by a table at work, &c.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
And you have seen him at Lady Melford's?

MARY.
Yes.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
And at Harrowgate?

MARY.
Yes.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
And have danced with him?

MARY.
Yes.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
And have found him very agreeable?

MARY.
Yes.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Well, fair befall thee for answering Yes to this last question! for I did believe thee hypocrite enough to have answered No.

MARY.
Your opinion of me is flattering.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
How could it be otherwise, seeing you receive him as you did when I called you into the garden? You came forward like a blushing schoolgirl, sent into her governess's parlour to speak to her Town cousin of the fifteenth degree. I'm sure I think Sir Robert Freemantle a Godsend to us, in our present condition.

MARY.
In your present condition! Is not this your honeymoon with my brother? At least, I should think it is not yet entirely at an end.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
O dear no! But would it had less honey and more shine; we want lemon juice for our sweetness.

MARY.
And you are in the way to have it. Indeed, my dear Harriet, if you are not aware, you will soon have too much of it.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Then, if you are afraid of this, do you apply the remedy.

MARY.
Willingly, if it be in my power; but what can I do?

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Give me something to amuse and interest me. I know Freemantle will be in love with you, if you take any pains with him. -- Nay, don't look so proud, Lady, -- I don't mean disingenuous pains; and then I shall have something to think of -- something to talk of.

MARY.
Have you ever been without this last resource?

MRS. CHARVILLE.
O no, Heaven bless me! I can talk of the last foreign mail, or the changing of an old turnpike road, or any thing, rather than hold my tongue.

MARY.
But you are not reduced to this necessity surely, with Sir Level's taste and Mr. Smitchenstault's philosophy at command.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
But I mean something that is worth talking about. Something that one whispers in the ear; something that one watches an opportunity to communicate; something that one speaks of busily in the twilight, in some private alley, with the bats wheeling over one's head; something -- O dear, O dear! I can enjoy this now only by sympathy.

Charville enters by a door behind the Ladies, but stops short on hearing their conversation.

MARY.
What a long sober face you put on! What are you thinking of now?

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Matrimony is a duller thing than I took it to be.

MARY.
Indeed!

MRS. CHARVILLE.
I was too foolish: I might have had my amusement for another good winter at least, and have married him after all, if I liked it.

MARY.
So you married to amuse yourself?

MRS. CHARVILLE.
My dear girl, what could I do? I was with my stiff grave cousins in the country: I was disappointed of a trip to the Continent; the Bath season was still distant, and there was neither county ball, horse-race, nor strolling players in all the country round: so when Charville presented himself again, and renewed his addresses, I was ready to have flown with him to the moon. And now, my dear little sister, if there be any grace in thee, let us have some amusement.

MARY.
Willingly, if I knew how.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Get into some attachment, and difficulties, and correspondences; for, next to receiving a love-letter one's self, there is nothing so delightful as peeping into the love-letters of one's neighbours.

MARY.
Ha, ha, ha! You might be easily satisfied; for I have only to give Mr. Smitchenstault a little encouragement, and we shall have love-letters enough to peep into.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Somebody is coming.
(Charville retires softly without being perceived, and Smitchenstault, by the opposite door, enters, with heavy creaking steps.) 

MARY.
See! the old proverb verified; speak of him, and he appears. Mr. Smitchenstault, you come in good time to give us the benefit of your exquisite sensibility. My sister there is painting a rose, and two buds which seem newly separated from it; and she must not put dew-drops upon each, you know, because that would be formal: now, whether should the rose appear to be weeping for the buds, or the buds for the rose? -- the parental or the filial affections prevail?

SMITCHENSTAUDT.
O de nice question! de sweet affection! de dear sympathy! de pretty affection! What you wish me to say? I am no moder; I am no bud; but I have de tender heart.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
So my sister knows Mr. Smitchenstault.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
She know? O de incredible delight!
(To Mary.)
Do you know mine heart? de heart of one who feel all de sublime delicacies, all de pretty commotion, all de genteel ecstasies of de soul of one lover.
(Ogling her absurdly.)
Have mine eyes told you all?

MARY.
Not entirely, my good Sir; for that would have been using your tongue exceedingly ill.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
O no! no tongue, no tongue! all heart, true heart, devotioned heart.
(Laying his hand on his breast.)
It be all here trilly, trilly, like de strings of an instrument, de poor instrument dat you will play upon.

MARY.
Not I, Mr. Smitchenstault; I want skill.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Let me teach you den. O de sweet tuition:

MRS. CHARVILLE.
O the charming preceptor!

SMITCHENSTAULT (bowing conceitedly).
O, dear Madam! I am de poor unwordy.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Say not unwordy, my dear Sir; don't, I pray you, do yourself that wrong.

SMITCHENSTAULT (bowing again).
You are very good. But if dere be in me any ting good, any ting noble, any ting amiable, it be all from de passion of mine heart, -- dat dear passion dat do make me, one poor philosopher, become like de lofty hero.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
O the surprising transformation! if one's eyes were but gifted enough to perceive it.

SMITCHENSTAULT (turning again to Mary ).
And you do know dat I have de tender heart?

MARY.
I have not quite so much penetration; but I really know that you are very polite and obliging; and perhaps you will have the goodness to hold this skein of silk whilst I wind it.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
De very great honour.
(Holding out his hands, upon which she puts the skein.) 

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Yes; that rose-coloured silk looks, indeed, like the bands of love; but those don't look quite so like the hands of love: you have been making too free with your snuff-box this morning.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
O it is always so; when I am in de great agitations, I take de great snuffs.

MARY.
So, by this, one may guess at the strength of your passion.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
And I am sure, for these few days past, there is no man in the kingdom who has been within half a pound of tobacco so fervent a lover as Mr. Smitchenstault.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
You do me de great honour.

Re-enter Charville.

CHARVILLE.
Ha, Smitchenstault! What do I see? Hercules with Omphale! A philosopher forgetting his dignity, and condescending to amuse himself with girls!

SMITCHENSTAULT.
O, dere is de potion dat put all dignity to sleep.

CHARVILLE.
I believe so; and, by my faith! yours is sometimes drugged pretty handsomely. But beware of this potion, which you have, I presume, received from one of these ladies; it may be dangerous.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
O no! it be only for de sweet mutual enjoyment.

CHARVILLE.
Well, let it be so; that's prudent; as much of it as either of them will share with you, may be taken with safety. But if this potion should have the same effect upon your genius as on your dignity, what will the admiring and expecting public say to it?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Let it have patience; I will give de public, by and by, all dat it will desire.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
And a little more into the bargain, no doubt, to do the thing handsomely.

CHARVILLE.
Yes, I'll be bound for it; your doctrine of energies will not be dealt out by such a scanty measure. And pray, amongst all your powers, have you discovered any that can bind the fickle fancy of a woman?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
O no! no bind! -- I do bind nothing, -- loose all: dat is my plan; de free plan of nature: so I do teach my pupils.

CHARVILLE.
A most agreeable lesson, truly: and you will find some ladies very willing to become your pupils; if, indeed, they are not already more qualified to teach than to learn.

MARY.
Dear brother, how severe you are! But a truce to philosophy! It is in matters of taste that we have been craving Mr. Smitchenstault's instruction, though he has not yet told us whether the dew-drops -- emblems of sensibility -- should be hung upon this rose, or the buds which have been torn from her.
(Pointing to the flowers Mrs. Charville has been painting.) 

CHARVILLE (eagerly to Mrs. Charville ).
Is it the flower I gave you this morning?

MRS. CHARVILLE.
O dear, no! It is the one Sir Robert Freemantle wore in his button-hole: we have not one in the whole garden of the same species. Come, do you tell us where these same dewdrops should be disposed of on this drawing?

CHARVILLE.
Dip it into the well, if you please, and it will have drops enough.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Dear me! you are angry.

CHARVILLE.
No, faith! It should take a thing of more importance to make a man angry.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Indeed, I think it should.

Enter Sir Level Clump, skipping joyfully.

SIR LEVEL.
Huzza, huzza! Come out to the lawn with me; come out to the lawn with me, gentles all, and I will show you a thing.

CHARVILLE.
What is the matter?

SIR LEVEL.
Such a discovery! Such a site for a ruin! Such a happy combination! A dilapidated wash-house for the foundation; an old stag-headed oak, five Lombardy poplars, and a yew tree in such skilful harmony, the rules of composition could not offer you a better. -- You must have an erection there, Mr. Charville; you positively must. There sat a couple of jackdaws upon the oak too, in such harmony with the whole; but they would fly away, hang 'em!

MRS. CHARVILLE.
That was very perverse of them; I suppose those same daws belong more to Mr. Smitchenstault's school than to yours, Sir Level.

SIR LEVEL.
But you lose time, my dear Madam: come away, come away! a hundred pounds or two laid out on the ruin would make it a morsel for the finest Ducal park in the kingdom.

MARY (to Smitchenstault, as they are going).
But we shall interrupt your instructive conversation.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Never mind: de poor good man! I always indulge de good peoples in dere little folly.

[Exeunt all but Charville. 

CHARVILLE (after musing moodily on the front of the Stage).
Such a craving for dissipation and change! -- A curious busy imagination. -- "Next to receiving a love-letter of one's own, nothing delights one like peeping into the love-letters of one's neighbours;" -- the true spirit of intrigue! Ay, but receiving love-letters of one's own; that is the best. A married woman and love-letters! How should she think of love-letters? A bad, a suspicious, a dangerous disposition. I think I know myself; I am not prone to suspicion; but for those strange words, I should not have cared a maravedi for her painting that cursed flower.
(Dashing his hand over the papers, and scattering them about.) 

Re-enter Sir Level Clump.

SIR LEVEL.
My dear Sir, why do you stay behind -- you who are most concerned in this piece of good fortune? You must come out and behold it. A few hundreds -- a mere trifle laid out upon it. If I could give it the form of an ancient mausoleum, it would delight you.

CHARVILLE.
Not a jot, unless you were to bury yourself under it.

[Exit the other way. 

SIR LEVEL.
What is the matter? What is the matter? How can I have possibly offended him? I am sure nobody is less teasing or obstrusive than I am.

[Exit. 

Re-enter Charville.

CHARVILLE.
Is he gone? He will suspect something: they will all suspect. I must join them, and pretend it was only a feigned displeasure. Married, married!

[Exit. 

SCENE II.

Mrs. Smoothly 's Room. She enters speaking, and taking a Bandbox from a Servant, who immediately retires.

SMOOTHLY.
All nonsense! if you had waited for it last night at the waggoner's, you would have got it.
(Alone.)
'Tis well it comes at last: my lady's present bonnet will surely fall to my share now.
(Opening the box.)
Let me see. O how smart and pretty! Did it but fall to my lot, now, to wear such things with their best new face upon them!
(Going to the glass, and putting the bonnet on her head, and then courtesying to herself affectedly.)
Indeed, I beg ten thousand pardons: I thought for to have come for to ride in the park with you earlier; but my Lord, -- Sir John, (ay, that will do) would not allow me; for you know I have not always command of my own horses, and them things we married ladies must submit to. O lud, lud! will it ever come to this? Such fine clothes, such a carriage, such a husband some girls have got, who are not, I'm sure, half so handsome. 
Enter Smitchenstault softly behind her, and looks over her shoulders.

O mercy on me! 
(Shrieking out.) 

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Hush, hush! What is de matter?

SMOOTHLY.
O, it is only you, Sir!

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Why, who did you tink?

SMOOTHLY.
Lud, Sir! they say that when people are vain, the devil is always near to take his advantage of it; and when I saw in the glass such a face staring over my shoulder, -- O dear! I was frightened out of my wits.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Fy, fy! dere is no devil nor nonsense. I will teach you better dan dat. But dere be de little God of Love: you have heard of him, pretty minx?

SMOOTHLY.
With his bow, and his quiver, and all that there?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Ay; he it be who do take de advantage, -- who do tempt you, who do tempt me, who do tempt every body.

SMOOTHLY.
O lud, Sir!

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Now, be you quiet; be not so fluster. You call dat fluster?
(She nods.)
Very well; it be him who do tempt every body. Do you know any body in dis house dat he is tempting now? Tink well before you answer me.

SMOOTHLY.
You said yourself, Sir.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Yes, but beside me dere is anoder.

SMOOTHLY (coyly).
La, Sir! how should I know?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
What you tink now of your pretty mistress, de sweet Mary Charville?

SMOOTHLY.
O Sir! if that is your point, I know nothing of that
(sulkily)
.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Come now, be free wid me: dere is for you. Buy ribbon, or de shoe buckle, or what you please. Now you tell me; don't she sometimes speak of me? make de little confidences?

SMOOTHLY.
O lud, no! ha, ha, ha!

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Come, come, no laugh; you not mock me. I know very well; tell me de truth. Dere is more money; dat will buy de little gown, if you please. Don't she sometime speak of me when you are alone?

SMOOTHLY.
You are so sinuating! -- O dear! to be sure she sometimes does.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
I knew it; I knew dat she did. Now, pretty minx, when she speak of me again to you, and sigh, and do so
(languishing affectedly)
, den do you speak of me too, you know.

SMOOTHLY.
And what shall I say, Sir?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
All dat you tink.

SMOOTHLY.
I fear, Sir, that would be of little service to you. You had better tell me precisely what I am to say.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Why -- why, you may say dat I am handsome.

SMOOTHLY.
Very well, Sir: if she is in love with you, she will believe me. And what more shall I say?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Say, dat in her place you would love me too.

SMOOTHLY.
O dear, Sir! that would be presumptuous.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Poo, poo, poo! not presumptuous. Say you dat, pretty minx, and I tell you a secret: when I marry your lady, I can love you bote.

SMOOTHLY.
Dear, Sir, would not that be wicked?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Wicked, pretty fool! what be dat ting wicked? I tell you dere be no devil in de world.

SMOOTHLY.
Truly, Sir, he does not seem to be wanted, while you are here.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Come, come, don't be afraid: I will love you bote.
(Bell rings.) 

SMOOTHLY.
My lady's bell: I must go to her immediately. She is in a hurry for her new bonnet.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Remember, den, and take dis wid you.
(Offering to kiss her.) 

SMOOTHLY.
O no! I am in a great hurry: we'll put that off for the present.
(Bell rings again.) 

[Exeunt severally. 

SCENE III.

The Wood near the House.

Enter Mary and Sir Robert Freemantle by opposite sides.

MARY.
Sir Robert Freemantle!

FREEMANTLE.
Yes, even so; both morning and noon, always Sir Robert Freemantle. However, I don't make this second visit entirely without pretence. My uncle sent me -- a very willing messenger, I own -- to inform Mrs. Charville that the botanical work she mentioned this morning is out of print, so she need not take the trouble of writing to town for it: but he has it in his library, which is entirely at her service, and will take the liberty of sending it to her.

MARY.
He is very obliging; and so are you. Shall I turn with you, and meet Mrs. Charville? She is just coming out to walk.

FREEMANTLE.
This spot is very delightful: had we not better wait for her? Do you begrudge me one moment of your company, which will so soon pass away? How fleetly that time passes in reality, which from the imagination passes never!

MARY.
Ay, so it does.

FREEMANTLE.
Do you remember the evening when we danced together at Lady Milford's? And the morning when I met you on your sorrel mare, crossing the heath at full speed, with your locks scattered on the wind like the skirts of some drifted cloud? And that little party to the cottage too?

MARY.
Yes, I remember it all very well.

FREEMANTLE.
Very well! I remember it too well. But I distress you, Miss Charville; for you guess what I would say, and my motives for remaining silent on a subject so closely connected with every idea I have formed to myself of happiness. I will not distress you: yet permit me to see you sometimes. Let me call myself your neighbour or your friend. -- Ha! Mrs. Charville already!

Enter Mrs. Charville.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
I saw you at a distance. How good you are to come to us again! for I have been thinking of many inquiries I should have made after my friend. However, I need not scourge my poor brains to remember every thing at once; for you are our neighbour, and we shall often meet.

MARY.
Mr. Crafton has sent by Sir Robert a very obliging message to you. The book you wished to see is out of print, and he will send it from his own library.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Good, dear, sensible Mr. Crafton, to keep such delightful books, and such a messenger to do his errands withal. To-morrow he will send me a novel to read -- a very scarce, clever work; and the day after that, some verses by a friend (we are great critics in poetry, I assure you); and the day after that, a charade; and the day after that, a riddle, of his own writing perhaps; and the day after that -- O, we shall make a great many days of the riddle! We need not guess it all at once; that would be improvident.

FREEMANTLE.
But, my dear Mrs. Charville, will you trust nothing to my own ingenuity in finding out reasons for doing what is so agreeable to me?

Enter Charville.

MRS. CHARVILLE (to her husband).
You saw Sir Robert at a distance too, I suppose We are all gathering round him, I think, like pigeons round a looking-glass.

CHARVILLE (to her).
I heard your voice at a distance, and guessed you had some cause for such lively animation.

MARY.
Is my sister often without it?

MRS. CHARVILLE.
If I am, it is but of late. When you look grave
(to Charville )
, it would be undutiful in me to be merry.

CHARVILLE (peevishly).
You are dutiful, and that makes you grave.
(Striding away from him, muttering to himself.)
I comprehend it; it is all plain enough.
(Checking himself, and returning to Freemantle.)
This beautiful morning, Sir Robert, has tempted you to prolong your rambles in the wood: but what has become of Mr. Crafton?

FREEMANTLE.
He went home some time ago: he dislikes sitting down to dinner fatigued.

CHARVILLE.
He is right; it is not good for any body.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Then Sir Robert will stay and dine with us, and go home in the cool of the evening. He has walked a great deal, and must be fatigued, if he return now.
(Looking wistfully to Charville, who is silent.)
This would be a most agreeable arrangement.
(Looks to him again, and he still remains silent.)
Don't you think it would?

CHARVILLE.
Undoubtedly, if Sir Robert will do me the honour.

FREEMANTLE.
I am very much obliged to you and Mrs. Charville; but my uncle expects me: it is near his hour. I must deny myself a very great pleasure: I must return immediately.

CHARVILLE.
Since we are so unfortunate, perhaps you are right. The clouds seem to be gathering for rain.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
It is only the shadow of the trees overhead: the sky is as clear as a mirror.

CHARVILLE.
Is it the trees? There are shadows somewhere.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
So it seems: but blow them away, pray. I can't endure shadows.

MARY.
Yet you like moonlight and twilight, I think.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
O, to a folly! When owls are hooting, and beetles humming, and bats flying about, making as many circles in the air as a summer shower does on the pool. Did you
(to Charville )
see the bat we caught last night?

CHARVILLE.
A bat?

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Yes, a horned bat; the ominous creature, you know, that fanciful people are frightened at. O yes, you must have seen it, for you are drawing in the muscles of your eyes and face at this very moment in mockery of the creature.

MARY.
Did you not see it, brother? It was very curious.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
He looks at no creatures but those which are bred in his kennels and his stable. I'll describe it to Sir Robert.
(Going to Sir Robert, and walking with him to the bottom of the Stage, talking, and demonstrating with her hands, while Charville and Mary occupy the front.) 

CHARVILLE.
So fond of natural curiosities: this is a new fancy, methinks.

MARY.
No; she is fond of painting butterflies, you know.

CHARVILLE.
So it seems, so it seems.
(Striding away, and pacing round the Stage with his eyes fixed upon Sir Robert and Mrs. Charville, till he gets close behind them, while they move towards the front.) 

MRS. CHARVILLE (continuing to speak as she and Freemantle come forward).
But that kind is larger, and speckled like a wilding's egg, or a cowry, or the back of a trout, so pretty, and so minute.

CHARVILLE (thrusting his head between them).
My Love, you are too minute. You forget that Mr. Crafton is waiting for Sir Robert.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Bless me! is your face there? I thought you were on the other side of us.

FREEMANTLE.
I am just going, Sir.

CHARVILLE.
O! Sir Robert, I beg that you will not go sooner than -- Mr. Crafton, I know, is apt to be impatient.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
And you have a fellow-feeling for him.

FREEMANTLE (to Mrs. Charville ).
So I may venture to tell my uncle that you receive the liberty he has taken in good part. Good day.
(Going.) 

MRS. CHARVILLE (calling him back).
But when do you write to your sister? There are many things which I wish to say to her.

FREEMANTLE (returning).
I shall have the honour to receive your commands on that subject whenever you please.
(She walks with him, again busily talking, to the bottom of the Stage.) 

CHARVILLE.
Does she mean to detain him the whole day?

MARY.
He has been here but a very short time.

CHARVILLE.
A long half hour by the clock.

MARY.
It is a clock of your own keeping, brother, and the wheels of it are in your own brain. I reckon it ten minutes.

CHARVILLE.
Are you bewitched to say so? -- He goes; see he goes now. No, hang it! he does not go yet.

MARY.
Why are you so impatient?

CHARVILLE.
I am not impatient: let him stay till doomsday, if he will; but I hate people who are always going and going, and never go.
(Stepping on to them hastily.)
It will rain presently: it rains now; would you stay here to be wet?

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Rain!

CHARVILLE.
I felt a drop on my hand this moment: look there.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
It fell not from the clouds then; but verily, I think, from your own forehead, How warm you are!
(Turning to Freemantle.)
Good day, then, I will not detain you. [Exit Freemantle. (To Charville.)
Well, dear Charles, since you are so afraid of the clouds, let us go into the house. But I must visit my bower first.

[Exit swiftly among the trees. 

CHARVILLE (after stalking slowly away in another direction, stops short, and returns to Mary, who stands on the front, looking after Freemantle ).
MARY.
Well, brother!

CHARVILLE.
My dear Mary!

MARY.
Well, brother; what would you say?

CHARVILLE.
I am going to ask a very foolish -- I mean an idle -- I should say, an unmeaning question.

MARY.
Never mind that; what is it?

CHARVILLE.
Has Freemantle really a sister?

MARY.
Is it possible that you have forgot the young lady whom you used to think poor Mordant resembled?

CHARVILLE.
Very true; it went out of my head strangely.

MARY.
Strangely indeed! Could you think he would talk of a sister, if he had none?

CHARVILLE.
O no, no, no! I have not an atom of suspicion about me; but I thought it might be a sister-in-law, or a brother's wife, or -- there is no saying how many intricate relationships people have, now-a-days.

MARY.
He could have no sister-in-law; for poor Mordant, though distant, is his nearest male relation.

CHARVILLE.
Don't mention that poor wretch. He would be ruined: it was not my doing.

MARY.
Did you dissuade him from playing? and were you obliged to receive all that he lost? My dear brother, let me speak to you on this subject when you are composed and at leisure.

CHARVILLE.
I am composed enough, but certainly not at leisure.

[Exeunt severally. 

SCENE IV.

An outer Court adjoining to the House.

Enter Isaac with a Letter, and immediately followed by Mrs. Smoothly.

SMOOTHLY.
Where are you going with that letter, Isaac?

ISAAC.
To Squire Crafton's.

SMOOTHLY.
Is it for the Squire himself?

ISAAC.
I bien't good at reading handy writ, as how my wit never lay that way; but I guess that it is either for the Squire himself, or some of the gentle folks of his family.

MRS. SMOOTHLY.
A clever guess truly; thy wit, I think, must lie that way. Give me the letter; I'll take it; I'm going there, at any rate.

ISAAC (giving her the letter).
There it is: I knows you like an errand to that house to see somebody.

SMOOTHLY.
Dost thou think I would go to see nobody, foolish oaf?

ISAAC.
Ha, but a favourite somebody. Ay, ay! I knows what I knows. John, the butler, is a mighty fine man, and goes to church dressed like a squire of a Sunday, and the poor silly tits of the village courtesy as he passes, and call him "Sir." I knows what I knows.

[Exit. 

SMOOTHLY.
Do they suspect me, then? I'll hide this in my bosom, and nobody else shall know where I am going.

Enter Charville.

CHARVILLE.
What letter is that you are hiding so carefully?

SMOOTHLY.
O lud, Sir!

CHARVILLE.
What, you are nervous, are you? I say, what letter is that? Who is it for?

SMOOTHLY.
Lud, Sir, I never read the direction, it's for the post.

CHARVILLE.
Why need you go out with it, then, when the letter-box is in the hall? Give it to me, and I'll put it in.

SMOOTHLY.
O Sir, that wo'n't take it to the place it is going to.

CHARVILLE.
Did you not tell me this moment that it is for the post?

SMOOTHLY.
Did I, Sir? I was wrong, Sir; I must take it myself.

CHARVILLE.
Come, come; no more waiting-maid prevarications! Give me the letter, I charge you, and I'll take it where it should go. Give me the letter this instant.

SMOOTHLY (giving it unwillingly).
There, Sir.

CHARVILLE (looking at the direction).
By heaven and earth just what I expected.
(Sternly to her.)
And you did not know to whom this letter is directed?
(Motioning her to go as she is about to speak.)
Away, away! Tell me no more lies: I'll take care of this letter.

[Exeunt severally. 

SCENE V.

The Butler's Room.

Enter Dickenson with a Paper in his Hand, which he looks upon ruefully.

DICKENSON.
Ay, this was the state of the cellar: what it will be soon, if all these palavering people, with their improvements and philosophy, stay much longer in the house, the Lord knows! That good bin of claret is melting away most piteously. Who's there? 
Enter Charville.

My master. I beg your honour's pardon.

CHARVILLE.
Hush! Let me be here for a little while.

DICKENSON.
What is the matter, Sir? you are very pale.

CHARVILLE.
Nothing, nothing. Watch on the outside of the door, and prevent any body coming in: there is not a room in my own house where I can be at peace for a few minutes to read a letter.

DICKENSON.
Are they in your study, Sir?

CHARVILLE.
Yes, yes! Sir Level is there with his cursed plans: they are in my dressing-room too; they are every where. Watch by the door, I say, for a few minutes. [Exit Dickenson. 
(Taking out the letter with agitation.)

"To Sir Robert Freemantle." Her own handwriting: that fair character for such foul ends! What man on earth would not do as I do? 
(Breaking open the seal.) 
A cover only. The enclosed. 
(Reads again.) 
"To Miss Freemantle." Is this all? 
(Examining the envelope.) 
What's here? A coarse scratched drawing of a horned bat. 
(Reads again.) 
"You will understand what I mean by this, though it is but a scratch." -- No more! By Jove there is some mischievous meaning under this! It is my likeness she would give under that of a bat, and she will add the horns to the original, if she can. 
(Reads again.) 
"To Miss Freemantle." If this should be a device now, lest the letter should be opened! I'll pawn my life it is. "To Miss Freemantle." We shall see; we shall see. 
(Tears open the enclosed letter.) 
Mercy on us! three pages and a half so closely written!

DICKENSON (without).
You shan't come in, I say.

CHARVILLE.
Who's there?
(Huddling up the papers.)
I must have time to read all this.
(Noise of voices without.)
What's that?

Re-enter Dickenson.

DICKENSON.
They are inquiring for you, Sir. Ladies and gentlemen, and all; they are going to walk.

CHARVILLE.
Let them go where they please. I'll take my walk elsewhere.

DICKENSON.
You may go out by the back stair, Sir.

CHARVILLE.
So I will; that is well thought of thee, good Dickenson.

[Exeunt. 

ACT III.

SCENE I.

-- Charville 's private Library. He is discovered sitting by a table with the letter in his hand.

CHARVILLE (reading).
"My dear Charlotte, I rejoice so much in the happy chance." -- Psha! I have read it a hundred times since yesterday. I'll look upon the hateful scrawl no more.
(Tosses it from him, paces in a disordered manner about the room, then returns to it again.)
What, does it take hold of me still? the fascination of a snake is about it; I cannot keep away from it: I must read that passage once more.
(Sits down again and reads.)
"Ah the cross fate that separates us so cruelly! We were once, as you know, within an ace of coming together, of consummating that dearest wish of my heart. Those dear woods of Oakenly! how dear they would then have been! The tender green boughs of spring with all their lovely blossoms would have smelt more fragrant; the birds would have sung more melodiously; the fair face of nature would have smiled more sweetly." These the sentiments, these expressions of one woman to another! It is as evidently a loveletter, as that my clenched fist presses this table. Some part indeed seems irrelevant; but far less ingenious commentators than our ancient text books have been handled by would find no difficulty in it at all. -- Ay, plain enough: here is a good rule to try it by: substitute Robert for Charlotte, and there is sense in it; without this, it is a mass of absolute absurdity. All this pains! Why not? I have heard of most intricate ciphering made use of in such clandestine matters. This is simple and more ingenious still -- and yet -- pest take these tormenting incongruities! Go, vile scrap! I must tear thee to atoms or thou wilt craze my brain.
(Tearing the letter furiously.)

Enter DICKENSON.

(Angrily.) 
Who's there?

DICKENSON.
Mr. Crafton wishes to speak with your Honour.

CHARVILLE.
Let him speak with the devil! are not the ladies below?

DICKENSON.
Yes, Sir; but he has express business with yourself, and would follow me up stairs.

CHARVILLE (in a whisper).
Is he behind thee?

DICKENSON.
Yes, Sir, close at hand.

CHARVILLE (in a low voice).
Let him come then, since it cannot be helped.
(Gathering up the torn papers hastily while Crafton enters.) 

CRAFTON.
Good morning, Sir; pray let me assist you.

CHARVILLE.
O Sir, I beg -- I shall do it myself in a moment.

CRAFTON.
(Stooping.)
Pray allow me; the pieces are as numerous, as if you had been plucking a goose, yet from your countenance I should rather have expected it to be a crow.

CHARVILLE.
No, nothing; an old tailor's bill that gave me trouble once, and I had a spite at it.

CRAFTON.
And you have wreaked your vengeance on it unsparingly.

CHARVILLE.
I think Dickenson said you were come to me on business. Have the goodness to be seated.

CRAFTON.
No I thank you; it can be settled in a few words.

CHARVILLE.
Well, Sir.

CRAFTON.
Our neighbour Dobson is going to sell his little farm; now it is a desirable possession for either of us, and I should like to add it to my own estate; yet I would by no means enter into competition with a purchaser of your calibre.

CHARVILLE.
I am very much obliged to you, Mr. Crafton; I'll consider of it; it is a very good aspect for apple trees.

CRAFTON.
For apples! you surely mistake me: it is Dobson's farm I mean; it is not my own little paddock, I assure you; that I will never part with.

CHARVILLE.
I beg your pardon: I heard you imperfectly. The farm! well, I shall consider of it. I am greatly obliged to you. Are you alone this morning?

CRAFTON.
Yes, my nephew is gone.

CHARVILLE.
Ha! gone! It is a delightful day for his journey: I am glad -- I mean glad of the fine weather he is getting. I wish him a pleasant journey with all my heart.

CRAFTON.
He is not gone a journey; he is only sporting with Squire Ruddley; I expect him to dinner.

CHARVILLE.
That's all -- I was afraid -- I thought somebody had told me he was going to leave you soon.

CRAFTON.
Myself, perhaps; for I had no idea when he came to me that he would have staid so long. But he has been so happy since he came, and you have become such a kind and agreeable neighbour to him, that I don't know when he will go. -- However, it is all very well, he has no agreeable home to go to, and I am the better for his company. I should not wonder now if he were to spend the best part of every summer with me.

CHARVILLE.
A very bad -- I mean a very extraordinary arrangement. Why does he not marry?

CRAFTON.
Why, in the first place, he has little money to keep house upon, and he is so whimsical and scrupulous that he will marry no woman, forsooth, unless he be in love with her; and a young man's inclinations, you know, Charville, will not be controlled by prudence and propriety: they will wander here and there. -- O dear! every where, where they should not.
(After a long pause.)
Well, you say you will consider of it.
(Another pause.)
Yes, I see you are considering of it.

CHARVILLE.
O no, not at all. The orchard-field that you wish me to purchase.

CRAFTON.
No no, my dear sir; the little farm which I do not wish you to purchase.

CHARVILLE.
I mean so, I mean so; I'll think of it at leisure.

CRAFTON.
And when you have done so, you will have the goodness to let me know the result.

CHARVILLE.
Certainly.

CRAFTON.
Good morning: I'll intrude upon your time no longer.

CHARVILLE.
Good morning. [Exit Crafton. (Alone, after musing for a little.)
"Every where, where they should not." Did he not glance at something in these words. "Young men's inclinations will not be controlled." -- "Every where, where they should not." -- I'll go live in the Hebrides -- at Johny Grott's house -- I'll travel for improvement to Kamschatka, rather than live here with such a neighbour as this at my elbow. -- What noise is that?

Enter Dickenson.

What do you want?

DICKENSON.
Would you have the closet doors set to rights, Sir? the locksmith is here.

CHARVILLE.
Who sent for him now?

DICKENSON.
My mistress, Sir.

CHARVILLE.
For what purpose?

DICKENSON.
To have a better lock put upon the north door of her dressing room.

CHARVILLE.
On that door? has it not been nailed up for a long time?

DICKENSON.
Yes, Sir, but she has a fancy to have it opened.

CHARVILLE.
A fancy! I'll have no locksmiths: I'll have none of his jobs done here.

DICKENSON.
It would be so convenient for my lady, Sir; for it leads to the back staircase.

CHARVILLE.
It leads to the black devil! -- Let him take his smutty face out of my house, I say; I'll have none of his jobs done here. [Exit Dickenson. Preparations making for some damned plot or other. O, if I could but devise some means of coming at the bottom of it! -- Wonderfully anxious that I should go from home now and then; to amuse myself; to bring her the news, forsooth. -- Could I but devise any means.
(Stands a while considering, then takes a turn across the room with slow thoughtful steps, then rouses himself suddenly, and rings the bell.)

Re-enter Dickenson.

Yes, it is you that I want. I have something to say to you.

DICKENSON.
At your pleasure, Sir.

CHARVILLE.
It is the little cottage by the brook which you wished to have for your sister?

DICKENSON.
Yes, please your honour, but you said it could not be spared; so I would not tease you about it any more.

CHARVILLE.
She shall have it.

DICKENSON.
Bless your honour! and the widow's blessing shall be upon you also. It is so very good of you to think of that just now: it is more than I could have expected.

CHARVILLE.
Well, say no more about it; the cottage is hers. -- 
(Dickenson bows gratefully, and is got as far as the door, to go away.)
-- Come back, Dickenson.

DICKENSON.
Your honour?

CHARVILLE.
This is not all I have to say, my good Dickenson. -- 
(A pause, Dickenson expecting what he is further to say.)
Hast thou ever been frolicsome in thy youth?

DICKENSON.
Sir!

CHARVILLE.
I don't mean in any bad way, Dickenson. Don't look so surprised, man: yet I think thou wilt be somewhat surprised when I tell thee what has come into my head.

DICKENSON.
It is not for me to judge of your honour's notions.

CHARVILLE.
Thou wilt hardly guess what I am going to say.

DICKENSON.
No, Sir, but something for your own good, I doubt not.

CHARVILLE.
Nay, don't look so grave; I am only going to try a little frolic.

DICKENSON.
That is what I should never have guessed, I confess.

CHARVILLE.
O! only a mere whim; eve y body has their whims: it is a whim in your mistress, now, to have that door opened.

DICKENSON.
Belike, Sir.

CHARVILLE.
But then you must hear what my whim is. I am to go from home, you know, this morning with Sir Level; but I shall soon leave him and return again, unknown to every creature in the family but thyself. Now, couldst thou provide some disguise for me that I may not be known?

DICKENSON.
Lord, Sir! every body in the house will know that anxious look of yours, and the sound of your voice.

CHARVILLE.
Do I look so very anxious, then?

DICKENSON.
Of late, Sir, you have; just, if I may be so bold, as though you thought somebody were hatching a plot against you.

CHARVILLE.
Ha! dost thou know of any plot?

DICKENSON.
Lord forbid, Sir! I'm sure that claret has been as honestly drank at your table -- 

CHARVILLE.
Hang the claret! thou art as honest a butler as ever drew cork. -- But as I said, Dickenson, I should like to remain for some time in the house disguised: is the new servant, who is coming to be trained under thee, known to any one in the family?

DICKENSON.
No, Sir, not a soul has ever seen him.

CHARVILLE.
Let me put on the livery intended for him, and prevent him from coming till my turn is served.

DICKENSON.
Lord, Sir! would you so far demean yourself?

CHARVILLE.
Never trouble thy head about that. Come and show me the livery, and I'll tell thee more about it afterwards.

[Exeunt. 

SCENE II.

The Drawing-room. A Table for Tea set out. Enter Dickenson carrying a Tea-board, which he places on the Table; and on the opposite Side Mrs. Smoothly, who goes prying about the Room.

DICKENSON.
What are you looking for, Mr. Smoothly?

SMOOTHLY.
Only my mistress's work-bag: she desired me to finish the collar she has been working at so long. We poor waiting gentlewomen have all them tedious matters to finish, as it is called; that is to say, to do two thirds of the whole.

DICKENSON.
Yonder it lies: I desired my new man to clear the table for tea, and he has put every thing upon the chairs, I see, which he should not have done. But he'll know better by and by.

SMOOTHLY.
It will always be by and by with him, I fear, poor stupid oaf. I wonder you could bring such a creature into the family. Isaac tells me he has spilt a plate of soup on my mistress's gown at dinner, which is very hard upon me, Mr. Dickenson. To have the fingerless fool spoiling my perquisites!

DICKENSON.
You'll get the gown all the sooner for that: why, he's serving you, child.

SMOOTHLY.
Serving me! I should have had it in a fortnight, and not a smutch upon it. And what do you think of his sneaking behind doors, and listening too? -- Speak of the devil and he appears: I see him at this very moment lurking in the passage.
(Calling off the stage.)
Come in, sirrah; it is you I am talking of, and I'll say all I have said to your face.
(Enter Charville, disguised in livery, and a silver waiter in his hand.)
I say, sirrah, you are a dirty, sneaking, curious fellow. What business had you to stand listening at my lady's door when I was dressing her for dinner?

CHARVILLE.
I mistuke the door, gentlewoman, judging as how it was the parlour.

SMOOTHLY.
Take you care again, lest I mistuke your nose for the handle of the door, and give it such a turn as shan't be for the beautifying of that knave's face of yours.

DICKENSON.
Fy, Mrs. Smoothly! don't rate him so for a mistake.

SMOOTHLY.
Mistake truly! he mistakes every nook and corner in the house, where he can stick himself up to listen, for the parlour. -- Take care, sirrah; for if I catch that snout of yours again where it should not be, I'll take the tongs in my hand, and treat you as St. Dunstan did the devil. I'll teach you to sneak, and to pry, and to haunt one so: I'll teach -- 

DICKENSON.
Nay, nay, Mrs. Smoothly, perhaps he is in love with you: you shou'd have pity on the young man.

SMOOTHLY.
In love, indeed! Such a creature as that in love with me! I wonder, Mr. Dickenson, that a man of your sense and discretion should take upon you to bring such an oaf into genteel service. Wait till your master return; he'll not suffer such a shambling fellow in his house, I'll assure you.

CHARVILLE.
Mayhap measter may think better of me than you trow, gentlewoman.

SMOOTHLEY.
I trow this, however, that he'll make thee pay for thy prying. He likes that business himself too well to share it with thee, I can assure thee.

DICKENSON.
For shame, for shame! to put yourself in a passion for such trifles. Don't you hear the company coming from the dining room?

SMOOTHLEY.
Are they?
(Snatches the work-bag from the chair, and exit.) 

CHARVILLE (looking after her).
The fair, obliging, pretty-spoken Mrs. Smoothly! Heaven preserve us! What creatures we may find women to be when we get behind the curtain! -- 
(To Dickenson). They're coming, you say. I'll retire to the darker end of the room; for Smitchenstault gave me such a look of examination at dinner, that I began to dread detection.

DICKENSON.
You need not fear him now, for he has taken his coffee below, and is retired to his room for the rest of the evening.

CHARVILLE.
Did my wife give him a hint to retire?

DICKENSON.
No, Sir? Why should she?

CHARVILLE.
O nothing! -- No reason at all. I only thought she might have done so. He is tiresome enough sometimes, and -- O no, no reason at all.

DICKENSON.
I think he has got some stones in his pocket, and is going to write something about his jolligy.

CHARVILLE.
He said that himself, did he? -- Ha! Here they come.

DICKENSON.
I think you had better retire till they ring.

[Exeunt Charville and Dickenson, and enter Mrs. Charville and Mary, followed by Sir Robert Freemantle. 

MRS. CHARVILLE.
But, Sir Robert, you have never said a word to me the whole day of the letter I sent to your care, and the elegant drawing on the envelope. You have surely received it.

FREEMANTLE.
I most surely have not.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
I gave it to the servant early in the morning. Can he have been so negligent?

FREEMANTLE.
The fault lies with my own man probably: he is a careless knave: I shall find it on my table when I go home.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
You will have a great loss, else, I assure you.

FREEMANTLE.
A drawing too!

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Yes; a most beautiful sketch of the curious bat, which you thought might be of the same kind with that which you caught last summer in Cornwall.

MARY.
But the greatest loss of all would be Miss Freemantle's.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Hush, child! keep my secret.

MARY.
It wont keep.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Then, I'll tell it myself. Long ago, Charlotte and I wrote romantic sentimental letters to one another, in imitation of the novels we were then so fond of; and now I have commenced my correspondence with her again in style, that will, I know, afford her a good hearty laugh, if she don't think my head turned altogether.

FREEMANTLE.
Is it sealed up? Could not one have a peep at it?

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Not for the world. But if you have great pleasure in reading curious letters, Mary can indulge you with one. She has a curiosity in her possession that is worth the gold of Ophir. Pray go and fetch it, my dear sister, if there be any good nature in thee, and I know thou hast a great deal.

MARY.
So entreated, how can I resist?

FREEMANTLE.
Must you have the trouble of going for it? O! no, no. I'll see it another time.

MARY.
Indeed it is no trouble; I shall find it presently.

[Exit. 

FREEMANTLE.
And in the mean time shall we examine that bust with the light cast down upon it? You will find that it has, so viewed, a beautiful effect.
(Takes a candle from the table, and goes behind a large screen at the bottom of the room, followed by Mrs. Charville, when, from the door left ajar by Mary, enters Charville.) 

CHARVILLE.
So, so, so! The philosopher sent off, and my sister sent off, and the screen to befriend them besides.
(Hearing them speak indistinctly behind the screen.)
Speaking low, too. Cautious enough, I find. Something bad in so much caution.
(Drawing softly near the screen.) 

FREEMANTLE (behind the scene.)
Such beauty and expression!

CHARVILLE.
Ay, ay, ay! The devil himself hath no need of the forbidden fruit, if he will talk to a woman of her beauty. -- 
(They speak again indistinctly.)
What are they saying now? It sounded like husband. O virtuous lady! she recollects that she has a husband. -- Some little impediment to be sure.

FREEMANTLE (as before).
And that look of modesty, too, forbidding all -- 
(the rest of the sentence spoken indistinctly). 

CHARVILLE.
Her modesty indeed! that wont stand in the way. -- They speak low again: they are whispering now. They are; flesh and blood can endure it no longer!
(Running to the table, and throwing some of the china on the floor, when Freemantle and Mrs. Charville, alarmed by the noise, come hastily from behind the screen.) 

MRS. CHARVILLE.
That awkward fellow again breaking more china. -- 
(To Charville ). This seems to be your only occupation in the family, Barnaby! Ha, ha, ha! how bewildered he looks! What brought you here now? You should never come but when the bell rings.

CHARVILLE.
Lud! They be always ringing in my ears, bells here and bells there, and silver cups a clattering. I does not know when I be wanted.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
I'm sure, Barnaby, I does not know neither; for I know nothing on this earth that one could want thee for, unless it were, for spite, to hand a cup of tea at a time to scald a neighbour's fingers. -- 
(To Freemantle as Charville retires.)
Did you ever see such a looking creature?

FREEMANTLE.
I don't know; he puts me strangely in mind of somebody or other, and I can't recollect who. Where does he come from?

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Dickenson says from Yorkshire.

FREEMANTLE.
It may be so, but his dialect belongs to no county in England that I am acquainted with. -- 
(Mary heard speaking without). Don't stand here, young man; keep below till you are called for.

Re-enter Mary.

MARY.
Here is the letter, -- a love-letter from an old schoolmaster to his mistress: but you must read it, sister, for I can't do it justice.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
As you please, but make us some tea first; the cramp words that are in it require a ready articulation.

Mary begins to prepare tea, when enter Dickenson, and Charville peeping behind him.

DICKENSON.
Ladies, I am sorry to alarm you, but there is a man below who says, he has found a person at the foot of a tree, not far from the house, who seems to be in pain, and that when he spoke to him the voice which answered him again resembled my master's.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Foolish fancy! but let us relieve the poor man whoever he may be.
(Exeunt Mary and Freemantle hastily.)
It is a cold night, sister; stay and put on a shawl. -- 
(To Dickenson.)
Bring me that shawl from the next room. -- 
(Charville gives a sign to Dickenson, and goes for the shawl himself.)
Surely, Dickenson, you don't believe that it can possibly be Mr. Charville: you would be more alarmed if you thought so. There is some trick in this: I know it by that smile on your face.
(Dickenson retires without answering, and Charville re-enters with the shawl.)
That is a lace shawl, foolish fellow, bring me the other. That would keep nobody warm, and be torn on the bushes besides.

Charville (rending the shawl in anger, and speaking in his natural voice).
And let it be torn into a thousand pieces! A bit of paltry lace, or any thing, is of more importance to you than the fate of your miserable husband.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Ha! is it you?

CHARVILLE.
Ay, you may start as if you saw an apparition from another world.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Nay, there is nothing like the other world about you. That coat and wig, and that ludicrous visage of yours, belong neither to angel nor demon, and are altogether earthly, I assure you; much more an object of laughter than of fear. Ha! ha! ha! What made you put on such a ludicrous disguise? If I were a vain woman, now, I should think you were jealous.

CHARVILLE.
Call it by what name you please, Madam; but the levity of your conduct, the unblushing partiality shown on every occasion to that minion of your fancy, your total want of regard for myself, but poorly concealed under the mask of easy general carelessness, has raised up that within me which every man must feel, who is not as insensible as the earth on which he treads.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
And you have, in serious earnestness, thus disguised yourself to be a spy upon my conduct. And you have, no doubt, made some notable discovery to justify your suspicion.

CHARVILLE.
Madam, madam! this is no time for trifling. It is for you to justify -- I mean explain those appearances, if they have indeed deceived me. Why is Sir Robert Freemantle so often in this house, and received by you with such indecorous pleasure and familiarity?

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Had you asked me that question before with open and manly sincerity, you should have had an answer as open and sincere; but since you have preferred plots, and disguises, and concealment, even make it out your own way. It would be an affront to your skill and sagacity to satisfy your curiosity independently of them.
(Going.) 

CHARVILLE.
Do you mean to expose me to the whole house?

MRS. CHARVILLE.
No, Charles; you can never be exposed, cruel as you are, without my sharing in the shame. -- Oh! oh! has it come to this.

[Exit weeping. 

CHARVILLE.
Ha! does she weep?
(Running after her, and then stopping short.)
No, no! she does not: there is too much parade with her cambric handkerchief for real tears: she does not weep; and yet I could tear my hair for spite that she does not.

[Exit. 

ACT IV.

SCENE I.

-- A Back Court, belonging to the House; Sancho discovered waiting by the Gate.

SANCHO.
Now, we see -- we see. White man great deal of money -- read book -- know all tat be good. We see -- we see. I wait long -- O here he come! 
Enter Dickenson.

Well, friend, what say your massa to my massa?

DICKENSON.
He has nothing to say to him at all. He is very angry with your massa.

SANCHO.
Very angry! Ay, my massa be poor, and every body be angry wit him. -- Your massa not angry, your massa very fond of him when he shake a te dice, and take all te money from him. Te tevil will shake him over te great fire for tat. -- You tell him, he be in prison; he be cold; he be hungry?

DICKENSON.
I told him every thing you desired me, but he has nothing to say to you. He is very angry, and wont see you.

SANCHO.
Angry! Wont see me! He shall see me. I watch him; I speak to him; I deal wit him. Angry! White man angry! Black man angry too.
(Going.) 

DICKENSON.
Stay a little: he sent this for yourself to pay your way back again to London.
(Offering him money, which he scornfully casts away.) 

SANCHO.
None for myself; me will beg my way back; me will take noting of him but his heart's blood, and tat I will take if I should give him mine own in return. -- May his money choke him! May te white tevil tear him! May his moter curse him! -- Angry! Sancho be angry too.

[Exit. 

DICKENSON.
Poor creature! I pity him: but he'll beg his way back well enough. He has been used to it, no doubt, in his own country.

[Exit. 

SCENE II.

An old dismal-looking Chamber.

Enter Mrs. Smoothly and Dolly by a concealed door in the pannelling of the walls, carrying lights, which they place on a table.

DOLLY.
What a dismal ghastly-looking place! It looks as like a chamber where some wicked thing has been done as any I ever see'd.

SMOOTHLY.
But no wicked thing has been done in this chamber, foolish creature! though a wicked man died here.

DOLLY.
Ay, no wonder he comes back again, since he was so wicked. I marvel you thought of taking the haunted chamber for playing your tricks in with that poor 'losopher: I durst as soon think of taking the church or the vestry. -- What's that?

SMOOTHLY.
I heard nothing. Poor creature! you are so ignorant, Dolly, and that makes you frightened. Don't you know that ghosts and all them terrible things never appear till midnight?

DOLLY.
And if so be, why did you ax me to keep you company? Housekeeper wants me below to pick raisins.

SMOOTHLY.
O la! I a'n't frightened; but I thought I should weary somehow to wait by myself.

DOLLY.
Ah, Mrs. Smoothly, it don't become me to say so, but I be feared that you and the 'losopher mean to do some'at that a'n't right.

MRS. SMOOTHLY.
Nothing worse than cajoling him out of a little money, which he loves like his own life; and punishing him for being so conceited as to believe that my mistress, forsooth, would make an appointment with such a ragamuffin as him.

DOLLY.
Hark; he's coming now. Good luck to you.

[Exit. 

Enter Smitchenstault (hastily and alarmed).

MRS. SMOOTHLY.
My dear Mr. Smitchenstault; dear deceiver!

SMITCHENSTAULT.
No honey words.

SMOOTHLY.
What's the matter?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Some one pursues me: hide me somewhere.

SMOOTHLY.
Mercy on us!
(opening the door of a small closet.)
Go in there.
(Puts him in.)
I'll get off altogether.
(Runs to the concealed door by which Dolly had gone out.)
She has shut it so hard, stupid idiot, that it won't open. What shall I do? O I remember.
(Opens an old wardrobe press, and creeps into it.) 

Enter Charville, followed by Dickenson.

CHARVILLE (speaking as he enters).
No; I could not be deceived. I'll take my oath it was he. If I had not stumbled in the gallery at that other cursed door, I should have got up to him.

DICKENSON.
Surely, Sir, your eyes have deceived you: it could not be Sir Robert Freemantle that you saw.

CHARVILLE.
Deceived! Do I not know his form, his size, his manner? Fiends seize him! I know them too well: they are before mine eyes all day long.

DICKENSON.
Then, perhaps, they were only before your eyes now in the same manner.

CHARVILLE.
No, no, no! Thou makest me mad. Do I not know one thing from another? Cannot one know one hateful face from another, though one be not absolutely within arms' length of the pest?

DICKENSON.
Nay, if your honour saw the face.

CHARVILLE.
Saw it or saw it not, I'll be sworn it was him. Did you not say yourself that you saw a man run hastily up stairs?

DICKENSON.
Yes, Sir; but it appeared to me to be Mr. Smitchenstault.

CHARVILLE.
Smitchenstault! Think'st thou I should not know a hog from a greyhound? Is Smitchenstault tall?

DICKENSON.
I cannot say he is.

CHARVILLE.
The figure I saw was tall? Is he slender?

DICKENSON.
I cannot say he is.

CHARVILLE.
The figure I saw was slender. Has he, in any respect, the appearance of a gentleman?

DICKENSON.
Not much of that, I confess.

CHARVILLE.
Then, teaze me no more by saying it was Smitchenstault; it was the devil as soon. Where can he have disappeared? There is no door for him to escape by.

DICKENSON.
What if it should be some apparition that has deceived you? This is the haunted chamber which has been shut up so long, and why it is open to-night, and lights burning, I cannot imagine.

CHARVILLE.
Ay, ay! There is always a ghost or a haunted chamber wherever intrigue and treachery are at work. But if it be not a spirit, I will dislodge it.

DICKENSON.
The closet door seems to move.

CHARVILLE (running to the door).
I cannot open it; somebody presses it to in the inside. Go fetch my pistols: I'll send a brace of bullets through it, and prove if the thing within be flesh and blood, or not. Run for my pistols, I say.

SMITCHENSTAULT (bursting from the closet).
Don't fire de pistol! I am blood and flesh.

CHARVILLE.
You here! Where is Freemantle? It was him I followed along the gallery, if there be any truth in vision.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Yes, dere be great trute in vision: it is one of senses. I feel, I see, I taste, I smell, I hear; -- one of de laws of nature which do force belief.

CHARVILLE.
Pest take your philosophy! Where is Freemantle? Where is the man I saw before me in the gallery?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Gone out by dat door.
(Pointing to the panel.) 

CHARVILLE.
Is there a door here?
(Searching for it.) 

DICKENSON (to Smitchenstault.
Pray, Sir, how did you see him?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
I peep tro' de chinks of de closet, and see him pass.

DICKENSON.
And what brought you here, Mr. Smitchenstault?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Only to take de little pleasance wid Mrs. Smootly, who is very fond of me.

DICKENSON.
How could that be, when there is no door there?

CHARVILLE (having just discovered).
Faith! but there is though, which confirms every word he has said.
(Bursts open the concealed door, and exit, followed by Dickenson.) 

SMOOTHLY (bursting from her hiding place in a rage.)
O you lying serpent! Pleasance with Mrs. Smoothly, indeed! Very fond of you! Pretty pleasance, indeed! I could burst with vexation.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Dear, dear: what for all dis?

SMOOTHLY.
And to take my name in your mouth too! Would not Dolly or the dairy-maid have suited as well for your excuse?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Dear me, pretty moute! too pretty to speak de scold.

SMOOTHLY (pushing him off).
Keep your distance, I say. Pleasance with me, indeed! Such a lie; such an aggravated lie; I detest all lies! Pleasance, indeed.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Don't be so angry; dere be no pleasance in dat, and dere be no reasons neider: and every body ought to speak wid reasons.

SMOOTHLY.
You provoke me worser and worser with your reasons. Pleasance with such a creature as you! I shan't be able to hold up my head in the family again; no, never. I'll let them all know what kind of a man you are. I'll let Miss Charville know that you only court her for her fortune. I'll -- 

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Hush, hush, hush! de poor pretty, angry, goody girl: here is de money for you.

SMOOTHLY.
I'll have none of your money.
(Going off disdainfully.) 

SMITCHENSTAULT (following her).
O but you will to': it is gold money, my dear, pretty, honey moute.

[Exeunt. 

SCENE III.

The Library.

Enter Crafton and Sir Level Clump, by opposite sides.

SIR LEVEL.
Good morning, Sir; you have followed my intimation pretty rapidly.

CRAFTON.
Sooner than you expected? too soon?

SIR LEVEL.
By no means; I am heartily glad of it; for it argues that you still bear the same partiality for this delightful place, and now is your favourable opportunity.

CRAFTON.
Has Charville at length resolved to sell it?

SIR LEVEL.
Resolved! I should not say resolved.

CRAFTON.
Then say what you please, and I'll listen.

SIR LEVEL.
Mr. Charville, I don't know how, for I am but just come from a little expedition in the way of my profession, has taken a disgust to it. -- I don't mean such as will incline him to sell it for an old song neither; but, in short, I give you notice as a friend, that you may have it now if you please.

CRAFTON.
And you do so with Charville's permission.

SIR LEVEL.
Yes -- no -- ay, in some measure I may say -- I don't know that I can say so altogether.

CRAFTON.
Nay, my good Sir Level, you have taken so much pains in matters of taste to make every thing plain, and smooth, and orderly, be so obliging as to infuse a little of this same improving simplicity into matters of business. It does not signify to me two straws whether Mr. Charville sends me this notice directly or indirectly. The same reasonable offer which I made him for the property two years ago I am willing to make him again, and more than this I cannot and will not give.

SIR LEVEL.
Property! what a bargain-making name you give to it now! the place of your nativity, the beauty of which you so much and so justly admired. Can any thing of sylvan scenery be more charming?

CRAFTON.
And your tone is somewhat altered also, my good Sir Level: this same sylvan scenery was only practicable ground when you last spoke of it to me. I must e'en repeat to you again, that I will make the same offer for it which I made to him two years ago.

SIR LEVEL.
But consider, my dear sir, how much it has been improved since then. My plans have been already executed, and this, though it may not become me to say so, should weigh with you greatly.

CRAFTON.
I am sure it weighs heavily.

SIR LEVEL.
And look here at this sketch
(unrolling a large plan upon the table)
-- look what groves, what lawns, what sweeping declivities and acclivities, what harmonious undulations! you shall have this plan -- the benefit of all this tasteful design into the bargain.

CRAFTON.
No, Sir Level; I am not such a Jew as to crib that in, along with the rest. I'll first, if you please, purchase the estate in my own plain way, and then you may ask as much as you like for your plan afterwards. This is, in my simple conceit, the best way of proceeding.
(Sir Level turns peevishly away.)
You think differently, I see. But here comes Mr. Charville himself.

Enter Charville.

SIR LEVEL (aside to Charville as he enters).
He's a cunning hunks, -- can make nothing of him. Will only give the old price. Deal warily with him.

CRAFTON.
I am greatly obliged to you, Mr. Charville, for communicating to me, through Sir Level, your intention respecting this house and lands.

CHARVILLE.
You have a right to be first informed of it.

CRAFTON (bowing).
I shall be most happy to become the purchaser at what has been considered by competent judges as a reasonable price.

CHARVILLE.
This estate is a more desirable purchase to you, Mr. Crafton, than to any other man.

CRAFTON.
I have, it is true, sentiments of affection for it, the old home of my forefathers, but I am not rich enough to indulge them to the injury of a moderate fortune.

CHARVILLE.
Sir, I ask no more, if we can agree upon what really is a reasonable price. I should not wish to exact exorbitantly from the amiable and tender feelings of your nature.

SIR LEVEL (aside to Charville ).
Pshaw! you may make him pay for all those amply enough, and take but little out of his pocket.

Enter Mrs. Charville.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Good day, Mr. Crafton.

CRAFTON.
And to you, Madam, this and many good days.

CHARVILLE (to Mrs. Charville ).
We meet upon business
(turning to Crafton ).
Let your agent and mine, Mr. Crafton, meet together, and -- 

MRS. CHARVILLE (drawing her husband aside).
Are you wrong in the head to part with this house so suddenly, so unadvisedly?

CHARVILLE (aside sarcastically).
Ay, you advise me to keep it, I suppose; you have your tender feelings too, and partiality for the dear place
(turning indignantly from her to Crafton ).
The place is yours, Sir, if our men of business can agree upon the terms, and I make no doubt they will.

SIR LEVEL (pulling him aside).
Rash, very rash to say so: he'll cozen your poor attorney, depend upon it.

CHARVILLE (turning again to Crafton ).
That is to say, Mr. Crafton, if after examining their report, I myself approve.

MRS. CHARVILLE (pulling him again aside).
Do not be angry with me for interfering; but where will you find such a pleasant residence?

CHARVILLE (as before).
Ay, Madam, and such pleasant -- very pleasant neighbours.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
What do you mean?

CHARVILLE.
O you cannot possibly divine.
(Turning to Crafton.)
Sir, let the business be settled as soon as you please. You shall have it at the price which you formerly offered.

SIR LEVEL (pulling him aside as before).
He laughs in his sleeve at your rashness. I see too well by the smile on his face that he thinks he has jockied you.

CHARVILLE (turning to Crafton ).
I mean with reasonable expedition; I am by no means in any particular haste.

MRS. CHARVILLE (going up coaxingly to Crafton as he is about to reply to Charville ).
Nay nay, my dear Sir; you must not tempt him: come to my dressing room, and let Mary and I have a few words with you. You must positively say nothing more to Mr. Charville on this business to-day. It is too bright, too pleasant a day for such ungracious dealings. Come with me, my dear Sir. You must not -- you can't refuse me.

[Exit leading off Crafton. 

CHARVILLE (looking after them).
Yes, she will lead him as she pleases. How coaxingly, how bewitchingly she speaks to him! Ah, how it once bewitched me! she is speaking so close to his face, to the old, withered, hateful visage of Crafton -- is she thus with every man? is she altogether shameless? Oh, oh, oh! this is not to be endured.

SIR LEVEL (returning from the other end of the room).
It is provoking enough; I'm sure.

CHARVILLE.
Ha! you are here: I thought you were -- Yes, I have been really provoked; for he seems indifferent, and I don't know how, in this business.

SIR LEVEL.
He wants to buy the estate as a profitable speculation: he despises our improvements; he even laughs at my plan, and holds taste itself in derision. -- Look here; I spread it out before him -- 

CHARVILLE.
Well, well; another time if you please: not now, I pray
(putting it away with his hand). 

SIR LEVEL.
But do me the favour only to observe -- stone-headed fellow! He would let the savage brushwood remain in the forest, and I'll be hanged if he would not plant all my smooth shaven slopes with potatoes.

CHARVILLE.
Let him plant them with nettles and worm-wood, an he will.

SIR LEVEL.
Your servant, Sir: I beg pardon; I intrude, I find. -- 
(Aside, as he retires.)
There are nettles and wormwood planted somewhere, that I was not aware of.

[Exit. 

CHARVILLE (alone, pacing up and down in a perturbed manner).
Ay, ay, it is very plain, it is too plain, it is shamefully plain.
(Stopping short.)
Mighty fond of this residence of a sudden. To be sure, where will she find another house so convenient, with back stairs, and panelled doors, and haunted chambers, and so many cursed conveniences?
(After pacing up and down as before.)
Because I did not find him, I did not see what was before my face as plainly as my hand, and, forsooth, it was Smitchenstault. O woman, woman! thy mysteries of cunning and contrivance! thou would'st deceive man as the evil one deceives thee. But it shall not be. -- What can I do? This torment of my mind; this disgrace on my state I can disclose to no one. This cursed world is no place for a man like me to live in: would I were out of it! -- O woman, woman! 
Enter Isaac.

What do you want?

ISAAC.
Please your honour, you are wanted in the justice chamber.

CHARVILLE.
What's the matter?

ISAAC.
Goody Bullock is come to swear the peace against her husband: he has beaten her all black and blue.

CHARVILLE.
And he has served her right. Let him beat her black and yellow next time.

ISAAC.
Why, please your honour, she is a good peaceable woman.

CHARVILLE.
Out, fool! she is a hypocrite, and a liar, and a jade. Let him beat her all the colours of the rainbow, an he will.

[Exit. 

ISAAC (looking after him in a bewildered astonishment).
He's surely bereft of his wits altogether. To call poor old Goody Bullock all them bad names, goes to church every Sunday, with her stuff cloak over her arm, and knits hose for the vicar!

[Exit. 

SCENE IV.

A Summer Parlour, with a Door opening to the Garden.

Enter Mary and Sir Robert Freemantle from the garden.

MARY (speaking as they enter).
And your uncle is bent upon purchasing this place.

FREEMANTLE.
He was born in this house.

MARY.
It is natural that he should wish to possess it; yet I am sorry for it. I have an affection for it too, and so had my brother; but he has taken some capricious dislike to it, I don't know how. -- 
(a pause). And you leave us so soon?

FREEMANTLE.
I feel, my dear Miss Charville, that it is right I should.

MARY.
How can that be?

FREEMANTLE.
Have you not perceived your brother's growing dislike to me?

MARY.
He is of late more ungracious to us all; but I must confess I have perceived something of what you say.

FREEMANTLE.
I perceive it whenever I come near him, in every gesture of his body, in every glance of his eye. I perceive too well that he has discovered my secret, and disapproves, more strongly than I had apprehended, my attachment to you.

MARY.
His mind is sometimes warped; he does not always judge fairly.

FREEMANTLE.
My precaution in paying my chief attentions to your sister-in-law, which, by my uncle's advice, I have practised, that I might not provoke him to discard me till a favourable turn in my affairs, then daily looked for, should entitle me to declare myself, and, I will also own, to engage Mrs. Charville more heartily in my interest, -- all this precaution has been in vain; and I find that my own undirected, incautious conduct would have been the more successful of the two: at least, I am sure it could not have been less so.

MARY.
Then pursue it, now, and retrieve your error.

FREEMANTLE.
That you permit me to do so, makes me a proud and a happy man. But you forget, my dear Mary, what I told you half an hour ago.

MARY.
What was it? I ought not to be so forgetful.

FREEMANTLE.
That the papers wanting to establish my right to the Shropshire estate, which my attorney has been searching for amongst our old family records, cannot be found. The letter I received from him this morning informs me, that he now despairs of finding them; and this being the case, I must despair of ever obtaining your brother's consent to our union.

MARY.
Despair is a strong expression.

FREEMANTLE.
But is it not a just one? I have not now the face, poor as I am, and poor as I shall probably remain, to propose myself as a match for you.

MARY.
Well then, Sir Robert, what makes you timid makes me bold. Have the constancy to wait till I am twenty-five: three years will bring this to pass; and then, if you still think me worth the having, and do not consider me as altogether antiquated, I am yours. My fortune will then be in my own power, independently of my brother's consent.

FREEMANTLE.
Is it possible that I am so happy? How frank, how noble! But should I take advantage of a sudden impulse of thy generous nature? -- Alas! I should be more virtuous than I feel I am. My uncle has offered to settle his very moderate fortune upon me: but in this case, my sister would be scantily provided for, and our poor cousin, who has ruined himself at the gaming-table, would be entirely destitute. I have therefore refused it.

MARY.
You have done right, and this refusal gives you a value in my estimation beyond any acquisition of fortune.
(Noise without.)
We shall be interrupted here.

FREEMANTLE.
Let us return to the garden. My formidable rival, Mr. Smitchenstault, must, by this time, have left it.

MARY.
And I don't think he observed us as we fled from him. He was only passing on to his favourite haunt.

[Exeunt into the garden. 

ACT V.

SCENE I.

-- A Grove of Trees, with a tangled Thicket in the Back-ground. Charville is discovered pacing to and fro, in a disturbed Manner, Smitchenstault peeping behind him, through the Bushes.

CHARVILLE (after muttering to himself confusedly).
A cloak! a convenience! a provider for disorderly passion! -- Noosed for this purpose! Her cunning, her witchery, her wickedness -- who could have imagined it?
(After a pause.)
Gain her affections from me! Are his person, his manners, his intellects superior to mine? It is not so: comparison has not produced it. Any man might have had her who happened to come in her way with baseness enough to attempt it. -- What can I do? There is no corroborated proof: the world would laugh me to scorn. -- Oh, it is ever thus! Would I had done with this envious, malicious world! -- Ha!

SMITCHENSTAULT (coming forward).
Don't start, my dear frent; I know all dat you do tink, and I am your frent.

CHARVILLE.
I have disclosed my thoughts to no one.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Your tongue has not; but when you come to my room secretly to ask of me if it was really Sir Robert dat I did see pass trough dat chamber, and when I tell you dat mine own two eyes do see him, your eyes, your visage, your body, your limb, every ting dat you have, speak for de tongue, and tell me dat you love no Sir Robert in de house wid your wife.

CHARVILLE (starting away from him).
I cannot live and bear it.

[Exit. 

SMITCHENSTAULT (alone).
Not live! Ah if he would be so kind! It would be good ting for me and de dear Mary. He never give consent to our matrimony; if he die, she be free to marry me, and give me de fortune. Very good ting! ay, very good ting.

Re-enter Charville.

CHARVILLE.
Forgive me, Smitchenstault; I am a miserable man, and you have discovered it. But tell no creature the disordered state in which you have found me. You are a stranger, and therefore I am the less distressed that you do know my misery; and you say you are my friend.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Yes, de true frent; all dat I do for you, I do for myself. Speak to me all dat you tink.

CHARVILLE.
That is impossible! I am miserable; I live in torture; I wish I were out of this hateful world. Could it be without crime, I would have done with it at once.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
What you call crime? Have you no more reason dat you mind all dat petty superstitions? Very pretty ting, indeed, to live, if you don't like it: who tank you for dat? I am free -- I feel dat I am free. I not come here to be unhappy; when I be so, I go away.

CHARVILLE.
Ay, but where, my friend?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
To de good sound sleep; to de notting.

CHARVILLE.
That were an effectual remedy. I am miserable!

SMITCHENSTAULT.
And what oblige you to be so?

CHARVILLE.
Ha, tempter! Would you have me destroy myself?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
No! I only wish you not to be miserable.

CHARVILLE.
How can I be otherwise?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
I teach you. Do you consider now, and do you tink, and do you say to yourself, "Why be I unhappy? I have de bad wife. O very true; oder men have de bad wife also. Dey call me cocklum." What you call de man wid de
(spreading out two of his fingers significantly)
-- ay, ay, cuckold. "Very well, oder men -- "

CHARVILLE (starting from him).
I shall run distracted!

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Ay; all dis not be pleasant, but it be foolish dat you let it make you miserable. But if you cannot help dis, where is de obligation dat you should bear it? Keep a your place, dey say: foh, foh! de place where I am best is my place.

CHARVILLE.
If I could but leave them my misery as a legacy behind me!

SMITCHENSTAULT.
O you will leave dat to Sir Robert; he will get de bad wife to torment him.

CHARVILLE.
Marry! Devil choke them! I would live to the age of Methuselah rather, were I wretched as wretchedness could make me. Marry!
(tearing his hair extravagantly:)
it makes me mad to think of it.
(Striding rapidly to the bottom of the stage). 

SMITCHENSTAULT (aside).
Foolish wort! I am all wrong here.

CHARVILLE (returning).
And you think they would marry?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
O no, no! I speak de joke: he be too wise to marry her, and den she will say, Oh, oh! and tink of de good husband she had.

CHARVILLE.
Think of me! Yes, she will then think of me. She must of think of me then. If I could but rend her guilty heart with remorse! If I could make her miserable!

SMITCHENSTAULT.
O no doubt of dat; she will be very miserable, and have de bitter misery.

CHARVILLE.
Ay, that were something; that were worth dying for. She will think of me then in the agony of repentance. If I could be sure of this, -- be sure.
(A pause of thought.)
But are you a man, and advise me to such a desperate act?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
I am a philosopher, and advise you to notting. But dere is de good reason, if you will hear it; -- de sober, well-considered reasons on bote sides of de question; and I will say dem all over to you in good order. First, dere be -- 

CHARVILLE (impatiently).
Not now -- not now. I am distracted.

[Exit. 

SMITCHENSTAULT (looking after him with disappointment).
He wont do it, after all, de chicken-heart, for as well as de English love to hang demselves. If he do, I have de sweet Mary, and all her fortune; but if he do not -- O I will say it be all a joke dat I did say to him, and den dere will be no more about it. Chick-hearted fellow!
(Starting.)
A noise amongst the bushes! What face is dat peeping through de leaves? Dere is surely no devil in daylight. My flesh creep -- foolish fear! it was noting. [Exit, and presently Sancho comes from the thicket, creeping on hands and feet. 

SANCHO.
Tat talky talky man chace him from tis spot, so convenient for it. But he no escape me.
(Looking carefully round.)
O still in te wood. Yonder he walk. I be near him again presently.

[Exit again into the thicket. 

SCENE II.

A small Glade in the Wood, surrounded with high Fern and Bushes.

Enter Charville.

CHARVILLE (after walking with hasty disturbed steps to the front of the stage, stops short, and continues musing for some time before he speaks).
She will think of all this when it is too late: it will embitter her days; she will then bear her torment in secret. She will know I have loved her; she will know it then. The time runs on; it should be done. O that it were done! But the doing of it is a fearful effort.
(Pulls out a pistol, and looks at it ruefully.)
Is there no way of getting rid of this hateful world but by this miserable act of self-destruction? O that some friendly hand would rid me of my wretched life! I cannot do it.
(Throws away the pistol, which Sancho, bursting from the fern, &c. takes up, and runs fiercely at him, presenting it to his head.) 

SANCHO.
Me will do it for you, and tank you too.

CHARVILLE.
Hold, hold! For Heaven's sake spare my life.

SANCHO.
Me spare you! you who ruinated my massa! You kite, you rook; you shall now be food for te rooks!
(Snaps the pistol, which misses fire; then Charville wrests it from him, and they both grapple with one another stoutly, when Sancho being about to get the better of Charville, Sir Robert Freemantle enters, and rescues the latter.) 

FREEMANTLE (keeping fast hold of Sancho ).
Villain, or desperado! keep still; for I will not quit my hold till thou art in safe custody.

CHARVILLE.
Brave stranger! How shall I thank -- Ha! Freemantle.
(Turning away his head.) 

FREEMANTLE.
Did you not know me? But that look of distress and displeasure! What does it mean at such a moment as this?

CHARVILLE.
Do not inquire. Your own conscience will answer your question. What has been your motive for lingering about my house?

FREEMANTLE.
You have discovered my secret, then, and the sight of me is hateful to you.

CHARVILLE.
What! you own it: the poor covering of secrecy is done away; you look in my face and own it. I am degraded even to this.

[Exit distractedly. 

FREEMANTLE (still holding Sancho ).
Is he mad? I cannot follow him for this fellow. Ho, help there! Holla, there!

Enter Crafton.

CRAFTON.
Ha! is it you, Freemantle? What do you here with that black creature whom you collar so tightly?

FREEMANTLE.
He would have murdered Charville. See, his pistol is on the ground.

CRAFTON.
Would you have murdered him, you rascal?

SANCHO.
Me true man and no rascal. Me rascal if me not kill te base cruel rook dat ruinated my massa.

CRAFTON.
Why, Sancho, my old friend Sancho, is it you?

SANCHO.
Me no your frien. You cruel to my massa.

CRAFTON.
Nay, nay, be pacified, faithful Sancho. I am a better friend to thy master than he is to himself, and I will prove it. He shan't remain long in prison: be pacified. -- 
(To Freemantle.)
Let him go: I'll be his warrant that he shall follow us quietly to the house. -- Wont you, Sancho?

SANCHO.
Me not promise.

CRAFTON.
But I will trust you without a promise.

FREEMANTLE.
Be it so, then; but he must not have the pistol again.
(Lets go his hold, while Crafton takes the pistol from the ground.) 

CRAFTON.
But where is Charville? Let us go to him.

FREEMANTLE.
I cannot. He knows my secret, and is so sternly offended, it is impossible for me to speak to him in his present unaccountable frenzy.

CRAFTON.
Never mind that. Come along; here is a letter that will make you stand firmly before him.

FREEMANTLE (snatching the letter).
The long lost papers are found.

CRAFTON.
Even so; read it as we go. -- Come along, Sancho. Thy master will be the better for it too; he will soon be a free man again.

SANCHO.
You say tat, -- you sure of tat, -- you swear tat?

CRAFTON.
Yes, yes; I'll say it and swear it too, if thou wilt not take my word for it.

SANCHO.
O good Massa Crafton! me tank you, me embrace you, me kneel to you.

CRAFTON (raising him).
Fy, fy, fy! Let no man be on his knees but when he is at his prayers. Come with us and fear nothing; though this was a desperate attempt, a very wicked attempt against the laws of the land.

SANCHO.
Me care for te laws when te laws care for me.

CRAFTON.
Well, well, come with us.

[Exeunt. 

SCENE III.

A Library. Enter Charville, in violent Agitation, followed by Mrs. Charville and Mary.

CHARVILLE (speaking as he enters to Mrs. Charville ).
No, madam; do not follow me; it is in vain to explain it. The secret is out -- the guilty secret is out: he has had the boldness to acknowledge it himself -- to acknowledge to my face. I am such a creature now as he need no longer keep measures with. Away, perverted woman! Do you follow me still? Do you look me in the face?
(Beating his forehead.)
He acknowledged it himself.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Acknowledged it?

CHARVILLE.
Yes, madam. You disdained explanation, forsooth. Your virtuous pride was offended, and since I employed disguise in the matter, I must find it out myself. I have found it out, madam; he confessed it himself.

MARY.
My dear brother, what was it he did confess?

CHARVILLE.
Art thou a fool? Canst thou not comprehend? That woman there, whom thou callest thy sister, -- thy amiable sister, -- that woman whom I married, -- that woman whom I loved better than myself.

MARY.
Nay, that is a mistake of yours, brother; for if you had loved any thing better than yourself, you would never have been in this condition. Your closeness and self-love have made you always suspicious. I thought, indeed, that a wife of her cheerful temper would have enlarged your heart, and -- 

CHARVILLE.
Hold thy tongue, simpleton; she has enlarged my head.
(Stamping with his feet, and beating his forehead.)
The whole world must know it now. Since he brazens it out himself, the shame is public. I shall be known to be -- 

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Nothing but a fool, and that you must submit to, being a distinction which you have taken so much pains to acquire.

CHARVILLE.
O woman, woman! thy audacity is amazing.

Enter Crafton and Sir Robert Freemantle.

CRAFTON.
Excuse this intrusion, Mr. Charville. I bring a culprit in my hand, who fears he has offended you.

CHARVILLE.
O most courtly phrase! That black villain who would have murdered me, he fears, too, I suppose, that he has offended me. -- Sir Robert, you have saved my life, and I cannot turn you out of my house; but you have made that life hateful to me, and I hate it the more for being preserved by you.

CRAFTON.
Be more calm, my good sir. He has, indeed, gained the lady's affections unknown to you, and -- 

CHARVILLE.
And may take her and her affections also, and the devil give them his benediction.

CRAFTON.
Well, Freemantle, e'en take the lady as she is offered to you, though it be not in the most gracious manner. Fortune is no object now; take her and marry her out of hand.

FREEMANTLE.
I cannot follow more pleasing advice.

CHARVILLE.
Marry her without a divorce! I'll not divorce her. I'll be hanged if I give her up to any man alive.

CRAFTON.
Pray, good Sir, turn your eyes upon the party. I believe this match, which my nephew has so long desired, may be accomplished without a divorce.

CHARVILLE (turning round and seeing Sir Robert with Mary 's hand in his).
My sister! you bewilder me. -- Where is my wife?

CRAFTON.
Most dutifully employed laughing at you in her sleeve at the other corner of the room.

MRS. CHARVILLE (advancing).
My dear Charles, I told you you would prove a fool at last.

CHARVILLE.
But, Madam, you have not yet proved it. -- Sister, let go that man's hand, and answer me a question. How long is it since he first paid his addresses to you?

MARY.
His addresses have been short, but I have reason to believe he has been attached to me since we first met, some months ago, in Shropshire.

CHARVILLE.
And I have reason to believe he has made thee a mere cat's paw of convenience, silly girl! -- 
(Turning to Freemantle.)
Let me ask you, Sir, why, in my family, your marked attentions were paid to that lady?
(pointing to Mrs. Charville.) 

FREEMANTLE.
My dear uncle, you must answer this question.

CRAFTON.
Then, frankly and honestly, I'll tell you the whole truth, which, in its full extent, even Freemantle himself is ignorant of. I counselled him to pay his chief attentions to Mrs. Charville, to conceal from you his design upon your sister, lest you should forbid him your house, and blast all his pretensions in the bud, being then ill entitled to propose himself as a suitor. And besides this -- 

CHARVILLE.
Why do you hesitate? Proceed. You will make your tale hang together, some way or other, I suppose.

CRAFTON.
Besides, I thought it might engage Mrs. Charville -- (pardon me, Madam, you were a stranger to me, and I had heard that you were fond of such attentions,) -- engage her to plead with you in his behalf.

CHARVILLE.
And this is your story? A simple plot, truly, for a simple man to listen to.

CRAFTON.
This is all my plot or story as Freemantle is privy to it; but there was another part of it concealed in my own breast, which shall be so no longer. I hoped that by making you jealous of his visits here to incline you to leave my neighbourhood, and restore to me at a reasonable price the possession of my forefathers. This sinister design has failed -- deservedly failed -- for I do not justify it; and now you have my sincere confession without reserve. I am sorry for the pain and trouble I have occasioned: can you forgive me, Charville?

CHARVILLE.
I will try to do it. I'm glad you have not got the manor though. -- 
(To Mrs. Charville.)
And can you forgive me?

MRS. CHARVILLE.
I'll try to do it; and if you are very good, and very penitent, and less suspicious, and less teasing, and more docile, and more obliging, I make no doubt but I shall succeed.

CHARVILLE.
So I find I have a great many changes to make.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Yes, Mr. Charville; and in return I'll make some too. I'll be grave, orderly, and demure before all men, smiling only on mine own wedded lord, when he encourages me to do so; three times in a week, perhaps, or oftener, as it may chance. I'll not whisper in the ear of my first cousin, unless he be blear-eyed, or have a hump on his back; and I'll neither go to grove, arbour, nor closet, till I have sent you before me to see that there be nobody there.

CHARVILLE.
Harriet, Harriet! I thought this would have moved you differently. You triumph, no doubt; but less exultation, and more candour, would surely have been as becoming. If I am more suspicious than other men -- I am not aware that I am so -- you must at least acknowledge that it was an extraordinary circumstance to have an honourable suitor to a young lady concealed in a family, and making his way through private doors, and by private stairs, to apartments which she did not occupy. This is no chimera of my brain, Madam; Mr. Smitchenstault saw it.

MARY.
I believe, brother, all that you really know of the matter is that Smitchenstault said so.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
But here he comes; and if he says so again, when confronted with Smoothly, we shall yield that point to you entirely. 
Enter Smitchenstault.

Mr. Smitchenstault, do you seriously aver that you saw Sir Robert Freemantle pass through the haunted chamber while you were in hiding there?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
Madam, I have eyes in my head; I see what I do see, and I know what I do see.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
We don't doubt that in the least; but did you actually see a man pass? and was it this identical man?
(pointing to Freemantle.) 

CHARVILLE.
Answer me, Sir, did you see this man pass through the chamber?

SMITCHENSTAULT.
In de imaginations I see one man very like dat man.

CHARVILLE.
In the imaginations! Then you have not really seen it, and you have told me an untruth.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
What you call false? What you call true? De imaginations is all dat we do know: de veritable real true is a foolish notion -- is a notting. In mine imaginations I see Sir Robert, and if in imaginations he was not dere, what can I help dat?

CHARVILLE.
Sir, go out of my house, and never enter it again, as long as you live.

CRAFTON.
Unless it be in imaginations, Mr. Smitchenstault.

SMITCHENSTAULT (to Charville ).
My good Sir, you are in de passion: dere be no good reason in dat. Be not in de passion: de sweet Mary will plead for me.

MARY.
Not I, Mr. Smitchenstault.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
What! you wish me to leave dis house? Ha! you only deceive; you be ashamed to own de tender toughts of your heart. You not wish me gone. It was your sweet looks dat keep me here so long.

MARY.
With the help of your imaginations.

CHARVILLE.
Out of my house, wriggling deceiver!

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Don't press him to go so immediately; for Mrs. Smoothly has some matters to settle with him before he leave the house.

SMITCHENSTAULT.
O devil! I not wait for dat.

[Exit hastily. 

CRAFTON.
Now, Mr. Charville, this point being settled, let me crave your pardon for a poor criminal in custody below: he is a faithful servant to an unfortunate master.

CHARVILLE.
Speak no more of it: my heart has often smote me on that subject. I have renounced the gaming-table for ever, and I restore to poor Henry all I have won from him, though it was, by every rule of honourable play, fairly won.

CRAFTON.
I believe so, entirely. But I wish the rules of honour came a little nearer to the good Bible precept, "Think not of your own matters, but think also every one of his neighbour's." You risked a small part of your ample fortune against the whole of poor Henry's, and you took it from him. However, in restoring it, you do what has seldom been done by men of honour; and, on the part of my thoughtless relation, I gratefully receive your generosity.

MARY (after a pause).
Charles, you look melancholy; what are you thinking of?

CHARVILLE.
What I never suspected before -- that I have been a very selfish fellow. -- Mr. Crafton, I know that this estate was purchased by my family at an unfair price. I return it to you for the sum which was given for it.

CRAFTON.
No, Sir; after the indirect means I have used to wrest it from you, I feel that I do not deserve it. I too have been a selfish fellow.

MRS. CHARVILLE.
Nay, if you come to confessions, I must speak also; I have been a careless, thoughtless, vain and giddy wife.

CHARVILLE.
I forgive thee, Harriet; and though I cannot own entirely that character of suspicion which you would all so decidedly fasten upon me, yet I will freely confess -- 

CRAFTON.
Have done with confessions. We shall all be wiser, and, I hope, better, for what has just passed, and therefore have no cause to regret it.
