ACT I.

SCENE I.

 -- Exterior of the Walls of Rhodes -- Bay in centre. Turkish Galleys enter the Port. 

Enter Sir Calydor and Robert The Rhymer , 2 E. L. H .

Sir Cal.
You delivered to her my letter?

Rob.
I did  -- as I was bid .

Sir Cal.
And she gave to you -- 

Rob.
A mark  -- in the dark .

Sir Cal.
Clarice, Clarice! thou rosy smiling Hebe!

Rob.
Exactly like to my Belphaebe.

Sir Cal.
By my sorrow, knave, but thy folly make me to smile. Canst thou not speak in reason for one time?

Rob.
I've nothing to do with reason  -- I deal in rhyme .

Sir Cal.
And dost strive to be a poet?

Rob.
I do so -- and I know it . Now, sir, and to be brief , for that thing is the chief ; you must understand, for that's the matter in hand . That since I was a baby  -- who now am but a gaby  -- I never could at this, or any other time , speak one or fourteen words together without rhyme . It may be my misfortune or my fault ; but 'tis as true as beer is made from malt . Well, sir, you come to the relief of Rhodes, besieged by the Turks? and very well your word you have kept, for you have played the devil with their works ; and since, as you say -- since you have come here over the water , you've gained the love of Sir Avelon's daughter  -- all very good , and perfectly understood . Now, Sir Avelon being as proud as a peacock, for so I've heard , and wears upon his chin a remarkable black beard  -- nay, more than that, if what I'm told be true , as great a tyrant as the man who murdered all his wives with the beard of blue . 
[distant march] 
Hark, a drum! the grand master and the knights of St. John of Jerusalem come .

Sir Cal.
Begone, fool! -- I'd be alone.

Rob.
Oh, what a fuss and bother .

Sir Cal.
They come.

Rob.
I know they do; and as they are coming one way, why I will go the other .

 [Exit, 1 E. L. H. 

Sir Cal.
Poor, faithful varlet. If thy brain were as clear as thy honesty is true, many a knight would wear his spurs with less pretension to their dignity than humble Rob the Rhymer. But to myself, I am on the sea of life like a worthless weed, floating unheeded by as the wandering billow wills it. Toil, fortune, and my two-edged sword have made me what I am, a knight of good St. John; yet many a warrior's lip curls up in scorn as I give glance for glance. And why, in sooth? Truly because a cloud of mystery hangs over my birth -- winning for me the frown of pride. Pshaw! why should I shrink within myself for this? Courage, Calidor, for the cloud shall pass away, and fortune guide thy fortunes safely through misfortunes night. He who first became a noble, became so from some good and worthy act -- illustrious in itself and beneficial to mankind. But, as the world turns longer on its axis, fresh wonders come to pass. They who degenerate must sink, and if doing good be good and noble, the people are the true nobility, the Commons are the Lords, the Lords the Commons. By heaven! I'd rather be called a mechanic, with the virtues of sobriety, good faith, and honesty, for in this there is honour, than to be born to a title and live to degenerate and disgrace it, for in this there is dishonour.

Enter Villiers De Lisle Adam, Sir Glorian, Sir Avelon, Sir Piers Malcolm , Knights , &c., 2 E. R. H.

Vil.
Sir Calidor, we greet you.

Sir Cal.
I bow to the knee.

Vil.
Arise, my son.

Sir Cal.
I touch my helm to thee, Sir Avelon.

Sir Ave.
I give you back your greeting -- though I do it not in love.

Sir Cal.
In the hate of Sir Avelon de Beriot there may be much honour, in his love there may be much less.

Sir Ave.
You are a boy -- green as a willow wand. Thou sapling soldier, to thy nurse!

Vil.
Sir knight! Lord Avelon!

Sir Ave.
Let the boy talk; young tongues will talk.

Sir Cal.
And so will older ones -- and to little purpose, too.

Sir Ave.
Thou art as petulant as an ape within a palm tree.

Sir Cal.
Thou art as venomous as an adder in the grass.

Sir Ave.
Thou art not what thou seem'st to be, as time will discover to all.

Sir Cal.
Nor art thou what thou would'st have the world believe, as time will discover to others.

Vil.
Enough! For shame! You Christian knights, and fight beneath the banner of St. John? Is the age of chivalry dead, or have Goths and Vandals crept stealthily into our ranks? Your hands -- let me join them.

Sir Ave.
Ice and fire will not unite.

Sir Cal.
By the rood, no more will oil and vinegar.

Sir Ave.
I was born to a title.

Sir Cal
I was found under a hedge.

Sir Ave.
Sir Avelon de Beriot was my father.

Sir Cal.
I never had the fortune to discover mine.

Vil.
Peace, boisterers! If feuds must grow like weeds amongst our host, keep back your quarrel till the Turk has left the land.

Sir P.
The time draws on; we have driven them to their inner camp.

Sir Glo.
Where sulkily they sit and quake with fear. Sad news for Sultan Solyman to hear the sword of the Christian has scattered his fierce Janizars, like chaff before the wind.

Sir P.
Murad Mustapha is a good general, and led his troops into our ambuscades with excellent precision. The fire from our battlements mowed down his turbans as the grass falls beneath the mower's scythe.

Sir Cal.
Sleeps Sultan Solyman, or drugs he his drink with a double opiate?

Vil.
Be not mistaken, Solyman sleeps not, for the which I'll give ye proof. News came from his divan, that stung by the repeated defeats of the Pacha, who now commands the Turkish troops, he has commissioned Kehama, with a force of six thousand men to set down here, before the walls of Rhodes.

Sir Cal.
Kehama, the Moor! Then we are lost.

Sir Ave.
Lost! ably and well spoken. If your heart droop, sir knight, tell not its terrors to our soldiery, or the panic may spread so far and wide, they may take the alarm and be frighted at a snow flake Kehama! a Saracen with a tawny skin! ha, ha! A dingy Moor!

Sir Cal.
Do not deceive yourself, this Moor has military skill, and courage to direct it. Believe me, Grand Master, it behoves you to be wary; I have fought myself against Kehama -- have seen the flash of his scimetar in the red field of war, and it strikes nobly.

Sir Cal.
Besides, he is a bigot, and puts his faith in a consecrated standard, called the fire banner, under whose auspices he has gained more battle-fields for the Moslem cause than you or I, Sir Avelon, have ever entered.

Sir Ave.
The Moslem habit would well become the dignity and grace of Sir Calidor, the Christian.

Sir Cal.
If all men were real Christians who professed that happy creed, cant would be less common and hypocrisy more out of fashion. I've heard of one, my lord, who on the day of prayer (the seventh day) entered the temple of our faith four goodly times, and much he profited, it seems, from what he heard, for at his coming forth he denied a farthing to a starving beggar on the step. I've seen a Mussulman returning from the mosque give good red gold to the hands of rags and famine Now tell me, sir, which of the deeds shall we laud most to the sky, the Christian's act of charity or the turbaned Turk's.

Vil.
To the point, and to a better theme; we trust that providence has rid us of this threatened foe. Last night a storm arose of more than common violence; this morn a Rhodian fishing bark brought unto me the news of Kehama's fleet, near entering our harbour's mouth, was stranded on the flats and all on board it perished. Peace to their souls and to Kehama --  joy to Rhodes.

Enter Sir Glorian , 1 E. L. H .

Sir Glo.
Audience with the Grand Master.

Sir Ave.
We hear. Whence came you?

Sir Glo.
From the sea mark, on the mole.

Sir Ave.
The news?

Sir Glo.
Dangerous and deadly; Kehama's fleet has escaped the storm; our galleys have been scattered, and he without a keel to stay him -- nay, now enters our bay to land his troops unopposed and unmolested.

Vil.
Is this to be believed?

Sir Glo.
Behold! see their ships, and hark how the distant song of the Saracen comes gladly over the waters.

MOSLEM BOAT SONG.

Over the waters, over the sea, 
Our keels grate on the strand; 
Bright is the flash of our scimetars --  
Hail to thee, Christian land! 

Vil.
To arms!

Sir Cal.
I say, to arms!

Vil.
Sir Calidor, in thy experience we put much trust.

Sir Cal.
I'll not deceive ye. Draw, brother knights, your swords, and strike for Christendom. Ho, there! look to the battlements, and every point of 'vantage! Remember, brothers, 'tis for your creed ye fight -- your wives, your mothers, and your children! Be firm and screw each sinew to the task! Let myriads come! Leonidas slew myriads at Thermopylae. Should we fail or fall, would ye rather groan out your last sigh on a sick bed, or rest within a soldier's grave -- a bed of glory. 
(shouts.) 
Ye look! your answer is in your eyes. Enough, enough. Caution, vigilance, and a determined soul will wrest the wreath from victory, whether she will or no. 
(distant shout.) 
Hark! 'tis the shout of the foe! Our answer shall be louder, and spoken by the cannon's mouth. But I prate, and a warrior's voice should be not in his tongue, but in his sword. Those who love liberty and gallant deeds -- on! on with me to Rhodes. Then unfurl our banners, and let our cry of battle be "the downfall of tyranny and oppression!"

 [Exeunt all but Sir Avelon, 1 E. L. H. 

Sir Ave.
A bladder, a drum, and a bubble -- all vapid and of little value -- and yet what noise will the smitten parchment of the drum return to the hand of the striker! To prove more clearly to my mind that the emptiest vessel is the most sounding, and what little worth is there in what the world calls eloquence. Do I hate this Calidor, or do I not? No; no further than that he is a bar to my ambition; and I despise all friendship and all faith but what rests here in this small bar of steel. 
(draws sword.) 
Sword, I honour thee! and I do kiss thy blade with more devotion than ever devotee kissed holy crucifix. Villiers Lisle Adam, he has my place. Carve out, my fortune's with thy edge, that I may sit in his. Ye glimmer in the morning light, and seem to answer aye. Yes, yes, it will and shall be so! I shall be chosen and he will be debased. Come, then, ambition come, and let me hug thee to my heart! Guide, guide my step to the golden path of glory! give me the clue that will lead me over the heads of other men! give to me greatness, my good, good sword, or give to me the gibbet.

 [Exit. 

SCENE II.

 -- The Battlements of Rhodes. 

Enter Rob the Rhymer , 1 E. R. H. running.

Rob.
To arms -- to arms! When other people take to their arms, efegs , I think 'tis time for me to take unto my legs . Let me reflect upon the proverb told me by my old mother  -- or, if I wasn't told by her, I know I was by somebody or other  -- 

"He who fights and runs away, 
"May live to fight another day; 
"But he who is in battle slain, 
"Will never live to fight again."
Which is very plain , and therefore here I don't think any longer I shall remain .

Enter Mumbo Jumbo .

Well, little snow-ball, where are you going to?

Mum.
Me is going away.

Rob.
You are going to do such thing -- you are going to stay. Come, be quiet, stand  -- what a nice little fellow you'd make to play the cymbals in a military band .

Mum.
Iss, Mumbo Jumbo like music -- me should like to be a sifer or a drummer.

Rob.
What drumsticks like you best, young gentleman so murky?

Mum.
De drumsticks dat em please em best is de drumsticks of de turkey .

Rob.
You are page to the Lady Clarice -- 

Mum.
Iss me be -- and a nice tall handsome, little nigger .

Rob.
Yes, when you grow some four or five feet bigger .

Mum.
Iss, and de ladies all call Mumbo Jumbo pretty -- an't they civil?

Rob.
Confound the ladies tastes -- for you are as ugly as the devil! If a really handsome man the sex would see  -- they might turn their lovely eyes a little more on me . Now, Mumbo Jumbo, there is a leg -- remark how beautiful and handy .

Mum.
Me does; but don't you think it massa, a -- a -- a little -- 

Rob.
A little what?

Mum.
A little bandy .

Rob.
You're a fool! Look -- look there's a calf .

Mum.
Iss, me does -- but he be such a little one it make me laugh .

Rob.
What!

Mum.
Oh, massa! me always laugh, massa, when de wind is south .

Rob.
Do you? Then now I'll make you laugh on the other side of your mouth .

Mum.
Oh, murder! oh! -- oh -- oh, crimini! oh cry!

Rob.
You rascal!

Mum.
Oh, Massa Bobby give to me a terrible black eye .

 [Exeunt 1 E. R. H. 

Enter Clarice and Belphaebe , 1 E. L. H.

Clar.
Sing me the song, girl, he used to sing and I to hear --  sing me the song of Calidor, before a father disunited us for ever.

Belph.
Your ladyship, it is so-melancholy -- let me sing something more lively. I have two airs -- given to me by Rob the Rhymer -- two English airs, your ladyship, and so beautiful!

Clar.
Of the sentimental cast?

Belph.
Oh, quite sentimental.

Clar.
What are they called?

Belph.
One is called, "Hey for Bob and Joan," and the other "Peas upon a Trencher."

Clar.
No, no -- they will not suit my taste believe me.

Belph.
Well, I'm sure! Bob and Joan is the most beautifullest of ballads, and a person cannot have any taste indeed, who cannot appreciate, and has got no taste for Peas upon a Trencher.

Clar.
Sing, as I told you.

Belph.
Well, I will sing. Poor thing! how ignorant she is, to be sure, of music.

SONG -- Belphaebe.

As evening shadows lengthen, when declines the orb of day, 
Comes grief unto my lonely heart, when my love is far away, 
When daylight and morning break, o'er the purple sea, 
To bring joy unto the mariner -- but, ah, no joy for me. 
He told me at our parting hour, that when he was afar, 
To sit on this green knoll, and gaze upon the evening star, 
And he would do the same to me, in lands beyond the sea, 
And dream beneath the waving palm of happiness and me. 

The summer sun has scorch'd the grass, it is no longer green, 
Who was my love is wedded now, to some rich outland queen; 
And he sits with his dark bride, I ween, beneath some Indian sky, 
While I may turn my pallid face unto the wall and die 
Thou evening star look mildly down, a maiden's death to see --  
I hear a voice -- I see a form -- that voice! that form! 'tis he! 

Oh, that sunny knoll is green again -- the ev'ning star shines bright, 
And my love has won a laurel crown, from out the raging fight. 

Pure is his faith, I did him wrong, for oft on the field of war, 
He has gaz'd and thought of his Europe maid, beneath the evening star. 
Roll on, ye days of happiness -- ah, many may we see, 
For how sweet comes joy from out the cloud of bitter misery. 

Clar.
I thank you, Belphaebe, and now retire.

Belph.
Yes, my lady. I'll go and take a walk upon the battlements, and treat the soldiery with the sight of a remarkable fine woman! What a pity it is, that with all my care and instruction towards my young mistress, I cannot succeed in making her as genteel as I am.

 [Exit R. H. 

Clar.
Ah, Calidor! how fondly art thou treasured in this heart. My nightly prayer, my waking dream; and yet how strong my father's prejudice against him -- prejudice that gathers strength as time gets older. Ah, unfortunate that I am to wake a passion in the breast of young Sir Glorian -- a passion never to be returned. I own him noble -- brave, and courtly -- my father's friend, and the world's ornament -- yet still my heart denies the sympathy of love to his. I loved but once: and should a nipping frost destroy and wither up the flower, my love would be a weed not worth the gathering. I ne'er can love again -- I cannot give the heart I gave away unto another. 
Enter Sir Calydor , R. H.

Sir Calydor!

Sir Cal.
Clarice! well met -- in the rosy light of morning -- 

Clar.
Speak briefly, Calydor, for I must back to my father.

Sir Cal.
So hasty?

Clar.
No, no, not in haste -- but there are evil tongues abroad. We live in a world of venom; and 'twill be pleasure for malicious men to say, Lord Avelon's daughter holds secret converse with her father's foe, without her father's sanction.

Sir Cal.
I am not the foe of Avelon, for is he not the sire of my Clarice? We cut not down the fig tree after the fruit is gathered.

Clar.
You never meet without a feud.

Sir Cal.
How can we meet without? If I avoid him, comes he not suddenly again upon my side? If I greet him, touches he again his helm? If I speak mildly, replies he not in wrath -- and in seeming wrath am I not forced to do the same? Ah, Clarice, I see this gives you pain -- what pain, then, must it give to me, the innocent offender? I would win the love of Sir Avelon if I could, for the sake of the love I bear to Sir Avelon's daughter. But time, indeed, does wear. I must to the battlement guard; the hour is fearful; and should I fall in the Saracen attack, will Clarice drop a tear o'er a soldier's grave? shall my name live in her memory?

Clar.
Calydor -- that I love thee above all mortal things needs not my tongue to tell, therefore, hearken, Sir Knight. I, who can never give my hand unhallowed by a father's will -- I, who cannot be thy bride in life, will be thy bride in death; and the comer that shall bring the news that thou art dead, shall bid the sexton dig the grave and toll the bell for Avelon's daughter. The light of love that shone upon thee living, shall darken only with thee in the tomb. Nay, no reply -- what I have said is spoken by heart, soul, and tongue. Be this the proof -- a jewelled crucifix -- wear it about thy neck, as a memento of a maiden's vow.

Enter Sir Glorian , 1 E. R. H.

Sir Glo.
Death and torment! I find you well employed, fair lady, and you, Sir Knight -- nay, do not rise from your knee, the position must be pleasant. The Knights of the Chapter had a call this morning to the mass. I came to summon you, much wondering at your absence -- but now I wonder not. Nay, do not frown, nor think I quarrel with a taste so exquisite -- while other knights pray at the shrine of a wood and stone Madonna you very wisely pay your adoration to one of flesh and blood!

Sir Cal.
This interruption -- 

Sir Glo.
Is troublesome. Under such circumstances such interruption would be troublesome to me, Sir Calydor. Lady of Avelon, is this to be endured?

Sir Cal.
Your interference, sir, or your hot and stormy temper?

Sir Glo.
Sir Calydor, you are a villain!

Sir Cal.
Draw!

Clar. (throwing herself between them) 
The hand that strikes, strikes through my bosom!

Sir Glo.
Hold! which of the twain is the man you love?

Clar.
Sir Calydor.

Sir Glo.
I sheathe my sword!

Sir Cal.
And I!

Sir Glo.
Your hand -- now your's, Calydor. Clarice, give -- give me a moment, or I choke! 'Tis past, and I am now again myself. Brother in arms, from a child I loved this maiden  -- knew her and loved her in the cradle, before I guessed the passion's name -- and until here you came I thought my love returned. The bubble has burst, and the flickering torch is extinguished. Take her -- take the hand that can never be mine; love as I have done, and you will love well; love her as I have done, and you will feel as I do now. Oh, misery! 
(rushes out, 1 E. L. H. ) 

Sir Cal.
My woe almost exceeds my joy. I'll after him, and, if possible, pour balm into the wound my better fortune gave. The happiness gained and extracted from the misery of another is but as a sunbeam gilding for a moment the dark and gloomy cloud of desolation. Clarice, farewell, and -- 

Enter Sir Avelon , R. H.

Sir Ave.
Hold! for now the time is come. Hear me, Clarice  -- and you, young man -- 

Both.
We listen.

Sir Ave.
You have long sought my daughter's hand, and the time may come that you may gain it, if you will.

Sir Cal.
What are the conditions? when the time?

Sir Ave.
Of the conditions more anon -- but I'll note to you the time. When she is in her shroud, and the priest say masses for her soul -- when she is dead, and I cease to be her father, and you, sir -- you sir, cease to be a villain!

Sir Cal.
Take back the villain -- hurled into your teeth!

Clar.
Calidor -- forbear Calidor! my own -- my own, own Calidor!

Sir Ave.
Your fingers dally with your faulchion's hilt -- is it a well-tempered blade you wear -- has it a point?

Sir Cal.
I could burst with suppressed indignation!

Sir Ave.
Indeed! Now mark you how calm I am, and yet I see my daughter's arms enfolding the neck of the man I hate!

Sir Cal.
You have your triumph, sir; content you -- you shall not stir my wrath again. You called me a villain -- accusation is no proof. Was I a villain, when midnight fire assailed your palace, here, in Rhodes, and I brought your daughter forth, when the rabble and yourself shrunk back aghast, as the rocking rooftree fell? Was I a villain when I saved you from the scimetar of the Turk -- and again, from the assassin's steel? Nay, in the senate, from the bench, when one arose and called you what you now call me, arose I not and gave the open lie? If slander gives you joy, drink of the bitter cup. My triumph is in this -- I have gained your daughter's love. The love of a virtuous woman is of all earth's gifts the fairest; and never will I give the jewel back to one who cannot estimate its worth  -- no, no, Lord Avelon -- althought thou art her father!

 [Exit 1 E. R. H. 

Sir Ave.
Nor shall you tear it from me while I have life!

Clar.
Have mercy, father! mercy -- mercy!

Sir Ave.
Wed him, and I will dower thee with a father's curse!

 [Rushes out, 1 E. L. H. -- Clarice clinging to him. 

Enter Rob the Rhymer , R. H.

Rob.
Here's a prodigious noise! I heard such a prodigious shout , I was actually compelled to come to see what it was all about . Well, I see nobody -- because there is nobody here to see . Come, all is quiet -- ah, that will be altered soon, for hither comes my wife that is to be .

Enter Elphaebe , R. H.

Belph.
Ah, how do you do?

Rob.
Oh, tolerably well, my love -- pray how are you?

Belph.
A little flurried .

Rob.
And so am I, and must be gone -- because I'm hurried .

Belph.
Is it true the Saracens are coming here to storm the place?

Rob.
Yes, and led on by a long tall fellow, with a copper-coloured face .

Belph.
And if he took us women prisoners, he'd kill us --  doesn't it so you strike?

Rob.
He might, perhaps -- or something else I shouldn't like . He has eight-and-forty wives to his own cheek -- for so the news is carried  -- and really -- you know I'm not particular -- but you know I should not like the Saracen to marry you, before to you I'm married .

Belph.
Well, well -- I must away .

Rob.
And I -- upon my life I cannot stay .

Belph.
Will you meet me at eleven -- by the light of the moon  -- to- night?

Rob.
Oh, hang the moon -- I'll meet you by rushlight -- 

Belph.
Alone?

Rob.
Yes -- and without the company of any one .

DUET  --  Rob. and Belph.

Rob. 
Meet me by rushlight alone, 
Alone -- when the weather is warm; 
And I'll tell you a story of joy, 
As long, and as strong as my arm. 

Belph. 
How sweet, by the banks of the sea, 
To walk, when the billow is still. 
But I doubt, if I come, you'll meet me --  

Rob. 
Oh, yes, 'pon my honour, I will. 

Belph. 
Sunlight's the brightest for love, 

Rob. 
That's all twiddle dum diddle de dee; 

There's much more fine fun in the dark, 
And rushlight's the light to please me. 

Belph. 
Oh, there's nothing like quiet and peace, 
Yet rows in the night will arise; 

Rob. 
That's true, for I once toddled home, 
With a shocking bad pair of black eyes. 

Belph. 
But should I consent to be your's, 
Oh shall we ne'er quarrel or fight? 

Rob. 
No, I never will knock you about, 
And I'll come home quite early at night. 

Belph. 
You blow your own trumpet, it seems, 
Yet I'll still to the altar be led; 

Rob. 
But if I put a horn in my mouth, 
Pray don't you place a horn on my head. 
 [Exeunt, L. H. 

SCENE III.

-- The Camp of Kehama, the Saracen.

Enter Murad Mustapha and Iran Bensallah , 2 E. L. H.

Mur.
You wrong me -- I resign my rank without a sigh, and confess the greater prowess of Kehama.

Iran.
Your hand -- and it is generous.

Mur.
I would rather be deposed, and see the crescent curling on the citadel of Rhodes, than be beaten from the walls, and behold our standards lick the dust.

Iron.
Is it true, that under this Fire Banner this chief has never failed to conquer?

Mur.
So I am told, and that it strikes not only terror to the foe, but fires the bosoms of its followers with lion courage.

Iran.
Hark, the distant march! let us meet and greet the chief. I see them winding up the hill, from the crest of this ruined bridge. The Fire Banner comes!

Mur.
They hither come to consecrate it. We will meet them on their march.

Iran.
Have with you.

 [Exeunt, R. H. 

 [Distant march. The Troops after a pause appear winding up the defile -- they then cross the Bridge, and come on the Stage in the following order: --  

Military Brass Band.

Party of Bedouin Arabs, or Hawks of the Desert.
Four Muftis; or, Turkish Priests.

Two Agas.
Bayaderes; or, Dancing Girls.
Kehama, The Saracen , with the Fire Banner.
Captive Christian Knights.

Keh.
Thy hand -- raise we our banner, which I do swear to place upon the crumbling battlements of startled Rhodes! aye and its light shall be the envied glory of the Christian world, I say it -- I, Kehama, the Moor!

CHORUS.

Kehama comes -- Kehama comes! 
To the Moslem drums, 
Kehama comes. 
Shout to the sky, our wild hurrah, 
Shout to the sky, our song of war.

Raise our Fire Banner high, 
Death to the foe, 
Palsied be the Christian host,

Keh.
Light the beacon on the hill! 
[Lights appear on the hill, at distance.] 

Chorus.

The Turban and the Prophet, 
The Holy and the true, 
Shall stand within the walls of Rhodes, 
If augury be true. 
Then draw from the sheath the scimetar, 
Kehama does the same; 
And bow to the knee our ranks of war,

END OF ACT THE FIRST.

ACT II.

SCENE I.

 -- Rhodes -- Trumpets.

Enter the Grand Master  -- Sir Calidor , 1 E. L. H.  --  Piers Malcolm and Knights .

Gr. M. (reading a letter.) 
"Wearied with life I go disguised to the Saracen camp. If I return, it shall be with information to benefit my brethren -- if I do not, think me dead --  but keep my memory green in the minds of our gallant few, and recommend me most to brave Sir Calidor.

Sir Cal.
Bravest and best! -- Oh that our jealousy had been in war and not in love -- that our combat had been for the foeman's banner, and not for a lady's hand. A boon grand master? -- 

Gr. M.
Speak it.

Sir Cal.
This is my day of watch, give my charge unto another, let me pass the portal gate to the rescue of Sir Glorian --  gloom and melancholy have changed him much since the brief month Kehama has been here. Sorrow and sadness sap the mind -- within the Saracen camp, and alone? -- such conduct is not rash 'tis madness at the best. Say aye to my request, and let me go.

Gr. M.
If he be lunatic, by what name most wise and worthy knight are we to distinguish you, who pant to perform the self-same action you epithy with madness in another?

Sir Cal.
I go to save my friend.

Gr. M.
And goes he not to save a host of friends? His life he casts into the scale, for me, for thee, for all the scimetar has spared -- Success attend the gallant but misguided boy. Thou art on the crest of a cataract, must pass the ledge, and fall into the thunder of the waters.

Sir Cal.
Not if we rouse Kehama with the thunder of our war?

Gr. M.
How bright and light are the dreams that gild the morning of our lives. By a false lens the eye of youth turns bad occasion to its own advantage, and gazes wrongly through the glass of sorrow. Why thou false reasoner -- to wake a lion would be to make him more strictly keep his watch and ward --  no -- the event must be waited for, not expedited. Give orders that no man leave his post -- Piers Malcolm, see the mandate be enforced.

Sir P.
It shall be reverend father!

 [Exit. 

Sir Cal.
I am denied then?

Gr. M.
I have said -- and hearken -- set bounds to your passion by reason.

Sir Cal.
A reproach.

Gr. M.
The sting of a reproach is the truth of it. -- To the Chapter House!

 [Exit. Gr. M. , with Knights , &c. 1 E. R. H. 

Sir Cal.
If Rhodes had twenty moated walls, and all of solid brass, to shut me in, I would soar with an eagle's pinion 'bove the battlements to try this grand adventure. Glorian is before me in the race of glory -- I cannot, must not, lag behind -- but the means to gain Kehama's tent? -- The means I have at my lodging  -- the masquing habit of a troubadour -- minstrelsy gains respect from either Cross or Turban -- propitious thought, which now to execute. Grey evening closes in, and when she draws her mantle closer o'er the sleeping world, I and Kehama will be side by side. Speed my true purpose holy St. John -- genii of good with thy broad wings o'ershadow me.

 [Exit. 1 E, R. H. 

Enter Belphaebe , 1 E. L. H.

Belph.
Oh! oh! oh! I wont' be comforted -- I wont live a day longer, I'll go home and be buried -- 

Enter Piers Malcolm , 1 E. L. H.

Sir P.
In the name of Heaven, maiden, what is the matter?

Belph.
Every thing is the matter -- oh! oh! oh! I'm a ruined young woman -- oh! oh! oh! -- 

Sir P.
Come, come, moderate your grief, and tell me your cause of sorrow -- what is it?

Belph.
I'm a ruined young spinster, I am, I am, -- oh! oh! oh!

Sir P.
Ruined! -- and by whom, young woman?

Belph.
By a young man.

Sir P.
Does the villian live?

Belph.
No -- That is the worst of it, the villian's dead. He has made me a widow before I was a married woman, and I can't put on black for him, poor dear fellow, because it don't agree with my complexion.

Sir P.
But are you certain he is dead?

Belph.
I'm afraid he is -- oh my beloved Bobby!

Sir P.
But are you assured?

Belph.
If he is'nt dead, he is terribly wounded -- the Turks have cut off his head, and the doctors say they have great doubts if he will ever recover from such a serious indisposition. You may live very well in this world without brains, as you very well know Sir Knight, but you must have a head if it be only to hang your cap upon.

Sir P.
But you may be misinformed as to the particulars?

Belph.
Oh! by no means -- no, I am acquainted with every particular about him. -- Oh sir, he had such winning ways with him -- the sweetest of dispositions too -- never out of temper when he was pleased -- besides he was proprietor of such a lovely dimple under his chin; he used to call it the dimple of destruction, and yet for all this, the cruel Turks decapitated off his head with a large crooked carving knife looking thing called a skimetar. But I'll never marry again, no -- never!

Sir P.
Never?

Belph.
No, not for three weeks.

Sir P.
Farewell -- thou miracle of constancy, -- but weep no more.

Belph.
Yes, but I must though, for the sake of propriety, but to oblige you, I'll only cry for ten minutes, and then I'll go home and get my dinner.

Sir P.
You could not do better, maiden. --  
(trumpet) 
We are called -- adieu to thee.

 [Exeunt with Knights, 1 E. R. H. 

Belph.
Well! now I'm alone by myself, and there is nobody here to see me look interesting, I think I sha'nt cry any longer  -- no! I wont', so thats decided; and, as I've lost one husband I must look out for another. But heaven help the men, I wonder what's come to them, for they all get out of my way so fast and seem as shy to me as sparrows in the summer time, and really they do kill each other in such numbers, that if they go on at this rate there will be sixty dozen of ladies to one dozen of gentlemen -- and then in such sad and dismal times, there will be no getting a husband for love or money. Ah! I'll make my arrangements before the winter comes on -- I will have one -- I can't help pitying the poor gentleman, whoever he may be --  but I will have a husband --  
Enter Mumbo Jumbo , cased in steel. I E. R. H.

Oh! here comes a warrior. He seems not quite tall enough to suit my taste, but in times of scarcity it wont' do to be too particular. Young gentleman -- are -- are you married?

Mum.
No! -- Nor me dont' intend to be.

Belph.
He seems cross, but a little flattery is sure to put the men into a good humour. All accomplished, polished, and most handsome-looking hero.

Mum.
Wat de debble does she mean?

Belph.
Great privation and pain must you suffer in defending this city.

Mum.
Yes me does suffer pain -- me gets whacked four times ebery day regular.

Belph.
To mitigate the toils of war, in case you should wish to take unto yourself a wife -- permit me to recommend myself.

Mum.
Iss! but me does'nt like a wife -- me wants to keep out of mischief.

Belph.
I assure you I am quite smitten with your charms --  
(aside) 
I wish he'd turn his head so that I could see 'em.

Mum.
I wonder veder she be make lub to me -- or to de suit of armour.

Belph.
I should like to look at his visage -- I am accounted to be a very pretty girl, and with a very fair complexion.

Mum.
Dat is vedy bad -- me no like a chalky face, me likes a black voman.

Belph.
The nasty beast, -- but I'll have him yet. Besides I've a fortune of forty pounds a-year.

Mum.
De debble -- vot is dat you say 'bout forty pounds a-year.

Belph.
I begin to agitate his passions. -- I say I have a fortune of forty a-year, together with a catalogue of furniture consisting of a turnspit dog -- a kitchen poker -- 

Mum.
This stirs mine passion up -- 

Belph.
With a warming pan -- 

Mum.
I feel de fires ob lub begin to rise.

Belph.
And a large brass copper kettle.

Mum.
Oh! Chickeraboo, I'm scalded all over, give me your lilly white hand, you are de prettiest woman wot ever was.

Belph.
I know I am, and so are you. I wish he'd turn his face. Pray my lord, are you fair or dark.

Mum.
Oh! me is pretty fair, when me is'nt bilious -- but when me is very bilious me looks very black.

Belph.
Are you bilious now my lord?

Mum.
Iss, very, -- look at me!

Belph.
Lawk, you are a nigger!

Mum.
Vel, and did I say I was'nt?

Belph.
Dear, dear, I cannot think of having you.

Mum.
Not have me pray, and vy not?

Belph.
I shall have a large family of whity browns

Mum.
You hab hurt my feelings. Woman, I divorce you.

Belph.
Stop! a black husband is better than no husband at all.

Mum.
Me should think so.

Belph.
Well, I -- I -- 

Mum.
You will be my chum-chum?

Belph.
I will.

Mum.
Come to my arms! we shall be like an ebony wooden table inlaid with ivory.

Belph.
But how came you to be a knight, and wear armour?

Mum.
Because dere is a proclamation dat ebery body must fight against de Turks, and dey have made me colonel over de nigger slabes. Look dere -- dere is a uniform for you! Don't I look like a knight?

Belph.
Yes, you do, and a very dark one!

Mum.
Iss! me belong to de guards.

Belph.
The body guards.

Mum.
No -- de black guards.

Belph.
Have you many in the regiment?

Mum.
Iss! there is a duke or two belonging to the regiment, a bishop is our chaplain -- besides dat, dere is a number of people dat call demselves respectable, whose hearts are blacker than the face of Mumbo Jumbo. 
(Ludicrous noise of the drum and gong without) 
But I must leave you -- the trumpet sounds to arms! Hark! dat is de military band of my regiment.

Belph.
Farewell, beloved Jumbo.

 [Exit, 1 E. R. H. 

Mum.
Farewell, beloved wife! and now I'll go and drink a bowl of rhumb!

 [Exit, 1 E. L. H. 

SCENE II.

 -- Interior of Kehama's Tent, with a view of the distant Country, by moonlight.

Kehama discovered examining a plan of Fortifications. Sir Glorian , in the disguise of a Christian Leech, standing in the back ground.

Keh.
Yes -- here is a point of 'vantage! No -- there the bastion comes too near the trench. Pshaw! I'll weary me no more to-night. Well, father, since you made abode amongst us bearded Turks, how like ye the hospitality of Kehama, the Saracen?

Sir Glo.
I have nothing to complain of.

Keh.
Nor anything to praise, eh?

Sir Glo.
Yes -- the determined obstinacy of yourself and Eastern horde, who have reduced an army of five thousand gallant men to one.

Keh.
Umph! Why should an army of five thousand gallant men have the obstinacy to defend a city I have made up my mind to take? Five thousand men reduced to one! Hearken  -- that thousand will I reduce to one man; and, as the Colossus of Rhodes -- the seventh wonder of the world -- is hurled to the earth, I'll send the sole survivor to Sultan Solyman as the eighth! Nay, no reply. For a short space I'll lean my cheek upon my hand, and sleep.

 Kehama sleeps. 

Sir Glo.
Now could I draw his atagan from his girdle, and sheathe it in his heart, but it must not be. Though the blow would give liberty, and raise the siege of Rhodes, honour forbids it, and I dare not strike. He sleeps! Now, then, to take my accustomed walk in this disguise through the Moslem camp, and stalk by their slumbering host, in the dead of the night, like a sheeted spectre. Clarice! Calidor! Oh, that the setting of my sun of life were come! Not for the sake of glory have I doffed my knightly garb, but for the sake of love, Clarice, and thee! Let me look on the face of heaven. 
(undraws curtain) 
How beautiful! the holy moon spreads over us her silver smile. -- In her beam I see the moslem crescent twinkle  -- the earthly emblem of heaven and pure Diana. -- And yonder, far away, in the thick gloom, like a prostrate giant, stretches the dark and the beleaguered city. I see the lights in the casement, and can -- so strong is fancy -- almost make palpable the lonely chamber where my mother died; and I -- I -- Ha! what is this just fallen on my hand? the luxury of grief -- a tear. Thanks -- thanks, and welcome, for I have not wept for many a long day. Joy, joy! In the human form when there is life the vein will bleed; in the human heart -- where grief is not so stubborn but a tear may flow -- it proves the heart itself is not yet broken.

 [Exit, through the tent. 

Murad. (without) 
I would speak with the chief, Kehama.

Centinel.
Kehama sleeps.

Mur.
Our business is important.

Cent.
Enter.

Enter Murad and Iran , 1 E. L. H. -- Murad strikes the palms of his hands thrice together.

Keh.
How now!

Mur.
May our chief live for ever!

Iran.
And glory gather around him!

Keh.
Speak!

Iran.
The janizary guard, out on a foraging party, have by accident taken prisoner the daughter of a Christian knight --  Sir Avelon de Beriot.

Keh.
Come, this is news, indeed! Let a purse of sequins be shared amongst the party; and, for the lady, bring her here before me.

Mur.
She is here, my lord.

 [ Clarice is brought in, guarded.] 

Keh.
A seat, for the Lady de Beriot!

 ( Kehama offers a seat to Clarice .) 

Clar.
You mock me. I am a prisoner, and to your arms.

Keh.
I am a prisoner, and to your charms. What ho, there! strike lute and dulcimer! a Christian maid comes to note how lives the Saracen!

Clar.
Hear me -- for I have much to tell.

Keh.
Which you shall tell as we sit side by side. What ho, there! let the rough march of war lead, by your leave, through the gentle path of love. Strike, lute aud dulcimer!

[A Ballet -- at the end of which Clarice lets fall a miniature from her bosom, which Kehama picks up.]

Keh.
You have dropped from its happy resting-place a gentleman, and I have picked him up.

Clar.
Ha! give me the picture back again! I treasure it beyond the worth of worlds. I prithee, good, gentle, and gallant Saracen, give that portralt back to me again.

Keh.
Ah! your breath breathes music, and your tongue drops melting honey; but still I will not give this little bauble back to thee again.

Clar.
You must -- you shall -- for it is the portrait of -- 

Keh.
Of your lover. Go -- go to bed. The ladies' chamberlain! 
[Exit Clarice, R. H. ] 
Murad -- a word. Is the night guard set?

Mur.
It is, my lord.

Keh.
I am not in the mood to sleep. Should any stranger wish my presence, let him come in.

Mur.
Without, there waits a troubadour -- who has waited long.

Keh.
Admit him. 
 [Exit Murad through the tent. 
A troubadour! A wolf in the clothing of a sheep!

Enter Murad .

Mur.
The troubadour.

Enter Sir Calidor through the tent.

Keh.
Good! you are welcome. Wine, and wait without.

Sir Cal.
Wine! art thou not a Musselman?

Keh.
With Turks I am a Turk -- with Christians I am a Christian. 
Enter Murad with wine.

Fill, troubadour -- fill. Here's to Clarice de Beriot!

Sir Cal.
Clarice de Beriot!

Ker.
Yes, Clarice de Beriot; you'll drink Clarice de Beriot?

Sir Cal.
Most certainly I'll drink Clarice de Beriot. But -- 

Keh.
But what?

Sir Cal. (aside) 
I've seen nothing yet of Glorian.

Keh.
Come, I have given you a lady -- give me a song.

Sir Cal.
I -- I --  
(aside) 
What shall I say -- I never yet could finger catgut, and my voice lacks melody.

Keh.
Did you hear me? Come, sirrah! strike a chord.

Sir Cal.
The evening damp has relaxed the strings of my lute.

Keh.
Then sing.

Sir Cal.
The air of the night has made me hoarse, and I -- I cannot sing -- that is, I cannot sing -- 

Keh.
Not sing?

Sir Cal.
I mean, my lord, not now.

Keh.
And I've my doubts if you ever could in all your life. Pri'thee, good troubadour -- nay, flinch not -- draw you closer unto me, and, as I said before, pri'thee, good troubadour, who are you?

Sir Cal.
I -- I -- 

Keh.
Yes, you -- you?

Sir Cal.
Why truly, good Saracen, I am a troubadour.

Keh.
You are, are you? why then, truly, good troubadour, you are a very bad one. Fill -- fill.

Sir Cal.
Well, come, I will.

Keh.
Have you filled?

Sir Cal.
Yes.

Keh.
Good: and as we have drank the health of Clarice de Beriot, we will drink the health of Sir Calidor of Rhodes! Aye, man! why do you set down your cup -- the man is a gentleman, is he not?

Sir Cal.
I am disposed to think so.

Keh.
Faith, and so am I. Come, quaff! To Sir Calidor and Clarice! I see no reason why those two names should be disunited. Do you?

Sir Cal.
No, none whatever.

Keh.
But come, to business, for these are not the days for getting drunk. My friend, as I said before, who are you?

Sir Cal.
A troubadour -- as I told you once before.

Keh.
I know you did, and I knew that you told me -- 

Sir Cal.
What?

Keh.
A lie!

Sir Cal.
Dog of a Saracen! this to me! I -- 

Keh.
Sit down -- now pri'thee sit down; I am more likely to believe your tale if you sit down, for I never saw a troubadour so angry on so slight an occasion,

Sir Cal.
Know you who I am!

Keh.
Perfectly well; you are like, sir, to -- to -- 

Sir Cal.
To what?

Keh.
This portrait.

Sir Cal.
That portrait!

Keh.
Is the portrait of Sir Calydor -- of yourself! the same you gave to Clarice de Beriot. Sit down, Sir Calydor, for I am glad to see you. So fill -- fill! I see you are about to speak, yet before you do, hear me and my proposal.

Sir Cal.
Go on.

Enter Sir Glorian through the tent.

Sir Glo.
Great Heaven! Calidor! and over the wine cup with the Saracen! I'll listen.

Keh.
Rhodes cannot against me long hold out. Now hither come you here as a spy, for the which could I not hang you up? Start not, sir, I shall do no such thing. Now, though I could take the city, yet to gain my end I must take time; and I would do that on the instant, which to effect will cost me some good months.

Sir Cal.
Well, sir.

Keh.
Well, sir, I know you love the daughter of Sir Avelon de Beriot -- 

Sir Cal.
I do.

Keh.
His chief objection springs from the source that you are poor -- 

Sir Cal.
I know it well. Proceed.

Keh.
Now, as Rhodes must fall. I offer this to you to cure your poverty -- this purse of gold; 'tis heavy!

Sir Cal.
Well, 'twill be but hastening the evil day, and therefore, as you say that Rhodes must fall, give me the money.

Sir Glo.
The Villain!

Keh.
You consent, then?

Sir Cal.
I do.

Keh.
This fellow is a greater rogue than I even took him for.

Sir Glo.
Calidor a traitor! Back -- back to Rhodes. Detested villain! we shall meet again.

 [Exit Sir Glorian through tent. 

Keh.
And now to business, and put up the purse -- you know well how to make use of it.

Sir Cal.
I do, insulter! to cast the trash -- made heavier with my contempt -- down to your dastard feet!

Keh
Why, how is this?

Sir Cal.
Look ye, Saracen -- you said that I was poor -- I am so! so poor, that I cannot afford, like richer men, to barter away for a bribe the gift that fortune gives the honest man --  and his honour cannot take away without his will!

Keh.
Well, then, give back the purse to me and keep your honour.

Sir Cal.
Lead me to death, for I am ready!

Keh.
Hush! not so loud, man -- not so loud, a lady sleeps in yon inner tent, and I'm sure you would not wish to wake the lady. Remember, you are in the camp of the Saracen!

Sir Cal.
It matters not if I stood in the jaws of death, I would have my say when my heart is in my tongue. Why have you put this insult upon me? A bribe, and to a Christian knight! Presuming Pagan, if the world itself was one huge diamond, and you the giver on't -- as I hope for Heaven, and am a mortal man, I would reject the glittering bait with scorn! Heap gold on gold till it reach the golden sky, and after all your toil, 'twould be too small a bribe for the wretch so base that would betray his country!

Keh.
What would Clarice de Beriot now if she heard you say to this?

Sir Cal.
Say! she would say what a virtuous woman should say to the man who resists temptation -- that I had acted well, and she loved me better!

Keh.
Would she say this?

Sir Cal.
I am sure she would, if she were here.

Enter Clarice , 1 E. R. H.

Clar. (rushiny in) 
She would! she would!

Sir Cal.
Clarice! Joy -- joy!

Keh.
Yes, it seems pleasant.

Sir Cal.
But now I think again, how came you here in this deadly part? Kehama, how came she here in the Saracen camp?

Keh.
Ah, that's my business! 
(trumpet without.) 
That trumpet! I'm sorry to part lovers, but you must away.

Sir Cal.
I am prepared! bring in the bowstring and the mute, that you may mark how calm a Christian warrior can die!

Clar.
You will not take his life, Kehama! you will not take his life!

Keh.
No, as he would take nothing from me, I will take nothing from him -- save and except this lady.

Sir Cal.
Whom I love dearer than life!

Keh.
I know you do. 
(trumpet.) 
Again! Begone! pass through our tents in safety; the watch-word is Kehama!

Sir Cal.
And must I leave thee here, Clarice?

Clar.
My Calidor!

Keh.
You trifle with my patience. If you are not brief, I shall assault! the city before you return to defend it.

Sir Cal
I am myself again.

Keh.
Quick, I say! for by my banner of flame I have sworn to level Rhodes unto one broad plain! Nay, she shall lie so low, that the plough share of the hind shall pass above her towers, and men shall wonder where she stood!

Sir Cal.
A deed to do, is not a deed yet done; and before her fall shall come, the blood of Christendom will flow like a red river! A kind farewell to thee! and the same to thee, my noble, noble foe! Should we meet, and I hope we may, look for me in the thickest of the fight, and there I'll look for you! Farewell until our swords are pointed at each other's breast, and we contend in the death grapple! Farewell, Clarice! farewell, Kehama!

Keh.
What a pity 'tis thou art not a Turk!

Sir Cal.
How great the shame that thou art not a Christian! 
(music.) 

 [Exit Calidor through the tent. 

Keh.
Rid of thee at last. Thanks, mighty Mahomet! But lady -- 

Clar.
My father! my poor father!

Keh.
Well, if he wants thee, let him come; to friend or foe my tent is open.

Enter Iran , through the tent.

Iran.
A Christian knight, who calls himself Sir Avelon de Beriot, claims to be admitted.

Keh.
So, so -- the plot thickens. Let him be admitted.

Clar.
My father! Great Heaven! what can be his object in visiting thee?

Keh.
That will time soon discover; so sit you down. Here is a veil, dropped by one of the dancing woman. Quick! cover your face, and hear what says your father! 
(she sits and veils.) 

Enter Sir Avelon de Beriot , through the tent.

Sir Ave.
I stand in the presence of Kehama?

Keh.
Sit down. You come, I presume, to ransom your daughter?

Sir Ave.
I ransom my daughter! No, the welfare of a foolish girl could never have tempted from the walls of Rhodes, Sir Avelon de Beriot.

Keh.
I may presume you love your daughter?

Sir Ave.
I love nothing, and I worship no idol but ambition. But may I speak before that veiled woman?

Keh.
Yes, yes -- she is but one of my harem. You will excuse her being veiled; the children of Mahomet never show the faces of their women to the Infidel.

Sir Ave.
To proceed, then: You would, I know, be master of our city, and you see before you a man ready and willing to make you so upon conditions.

Clar.
My father a villain!

Sir Ave.
Ah! did the lady speak?

Keh.
She only speaks the Turkish tongue. I think, before we part, she will be able to understand you, though you yourself may fail in detecting her. But go on.

Sir Ave.
I have been wronged by the Grand Master of Rhodes; now if you take the city, and by my means, will you give the place he holds to me?

Keh.
Your hand -- I will; and much more bounty. Here's an outrageous villain! Go on -- continue.

Sir Ave.
Now hear the means that I propose: Last night died at my chambers a moresco and freed man, but a drunken varlet; your height and complexion are marvellously like to his. Now, come you to the southern portal, my watch there will be soon -- I will admit and clothe you in the selfsame garb I took from the moresco.

Ker.
What further -- are my soldiers then to be admitted?

Sir Ave.
No, that would ruin all. No, Rhodes must be conquered by other means than force! By guile -- by poison!

Clar.
Ha!

Sir Ave.
The lady seems agitated -- she spoke again.

Keh.
You cannot hope to stop a woman's tongue. But you spoke of poison -- how to be administered?

Sir Ave.
Thrown into the public aqueduct -- the water poisoned, the inhabitants will drop like dogs, and we shall live to see it. Is it not a brave plan?

Clar.
Oh, monstrous!

Keh.
Excellent.

Sir Ave.
Say that you like it, and I will depart.

Keh.
I do.

Sir Ave.
At the southern portal gate you'll meet me?

Keh.
I'll be there.

Sir Ave.
And my reward shall be -- 

Keh.
Well worthy of your design.

Sir Ave.
Adieu.

Keh.
But your daughter -- will you not stay to speak with her?

Sir Ave.
My daughter! I have no daughter. Avelon de Beriot has little time to spare to see a woman weep. To one passion -- and only one, is this heart open -- ambition! to all the rest it's marble.

 [Exit Sir Avelon , through the tent. 

Keh.
These Christians vaunt their creed; but if this be a specimen of true Christianity -- thanks, Mahomet! that I am not a Christian. Speak, lady.

Clar.
I -- I cannot; there comes a tightness in my throat -- a dulness to my faculties, and a heaviness to this wretched heart, as if a labouring mountain weighed upon my heart! Am I awake -- give me your hand! Is this you I feel stand here? Am I myself? Yes -- yes, 'tis true. Horrid and dread reality, I am de Beriot's daughter, and what can be on earth a greater curse?

Keh.
Calm yourself, lady.

Clar.
Calm! yes, I'll be calm; calm as the whirlwind --  gentle as the raging sea! Noble and valiant soldier, have pity on me! Behold me at your feet!

Keh.
What would ye?

Clar.
Let me go back to Rhodes -- prevent a father's crime, and save a suffering people! See how I cling unto your garment! Hear me, and I will bathe your feet with tears! be generous as well as brave! Say, say that little word return, and I will pray for you in your nights of sorrow -- become your slave -- hew wood, draw water -- do anything, however vile! Love, reverence, worship you, if you will spare from crime my father!

Keh.
It cannot be. 
Enter Iran , through the tent.

My shield! I must to my post!

Clar.
You will not listen, then?

Keh.
This tent is your prison -- you go not back to Rhodes! Attempt to escape my power at your peril!

Clar.
Oh, mark my agony!

Keh.
Begone!

Clar.
Lost! lost!

Enter Mumbo Jumbo in armour, 1 E. R. H.

Mum.
Him has been fighting, and him is very tired; me was tired before me began to fight, and me was quite knocked up before me knocked anybody down in de battle. Oh, dem debelish Turks! One on 'em hit Mumbo Jumbo such a dam hard knock on de bottom of mine head, dat he make a bump as big as a potatoe -- me feel him now vid mine little finger. He get bigger and bigger ebery moment, and if he no stop, I shall neber be able to get hat big enough for Mumbo Jumbo. Oh, de debble! Here comes de enemy, and my blackguard regiment has gone home to dare wives and families, and be d -- d to 'em. Oh, General Mumbo Jumbo will be taken prisoner!

A Christian knight! destroy him!

Iran.

Mur.
He has fallen. Shall we plunder him?

Iran.
Not at this time -- but when we shall return.

Mum.
Me don't tink I'm dead; let me pinch myself. Oh, oh! no, me is as lively as a cock sparrow. 
Enter Rob The Rhymer, 1 E. L. H.

Oh, here comes a Turk. He has got no scimetar, and me has got a great big cudgel -- and me will take him prisoner. Yield, or with you it will be worse.

Rob.
Yield! I'll see you at the devil first. Yield! no, no, don't take me for a flat -- so you take this, and this, and that, and that. Lay on my cudgel tough .

Mum.
Now, don't you trouble yourself -- I've had enough. 
(driven off.) 

Enter Avelon and Knight, 2 E. R. H.

Knight.
Be speedy, good Sir Avelon.

Sir Ave.
A step will bring us out of danger. On!

Enter Murad and Iran, 1 E. R. H.

Mur.
Yield, Christian dogs!

Sir Ave.
We sprang not from a yielding stock. Have at ye, Pagans!

 [Combat, and exit. 

Mur.
Oh, here has been a battle! I'm wounded in the funny bone; quite out of joint, I do declare. Oh, what a treat ! and, as Rob the Rhymer would say, I'll now go home and physic take -- and the doctor's stuff shall be a joint of meat .

 [Exit, 2 E. R. H. 

SCENE IV.

 -- Gardens of the Palace belonging to the Grand Master of Rhodes.

Enter Fatty Ben Abrams , with Belphaebe, 1 E. L. H.

Fat.
And so you have made up your mind to marry this black individual?

Belph.
Yes, father, I have; though I don't like him half so well as Rob the Rhymer. But then, you see, Rob is dead, and I don't want a dead gentleman -- I want a living one. By the bye, father, didn't you say something about a fortune? I hope when I become a bride I shall be allowed pin money.

Fat.
Why certainly, my child, I did promise you a fortune; but, you see, I am proprietor of seven small tenements, and as the tenants never pay any rent, I am not very rich -- but still you shall have a fortune. Oh, yes, you shall have a fortune, after -- 

Belph.
After what, father?

Fatty.
After I am dead. But here comes the bridegroom and the neighbours. 
(music.) 

Enter Mumbo Jumbo , Rhodian Girls . &c., 1 E. R. H.

Belph.
Oh, my beloved Mumbo Jumbo! you pretty man!

Mum.
Iss, me is very pretty; but me is in a horrid bad temper. Look at dis leg, and look at dis. Oh, dear!

Belph.
Bless me! why you have got a white silk stocking on one leg, and on the other you have got nothing at all.

Mum.
Iss; and it don't make me look like a gentleman -- now does me?

Fatty.
Well, but how does this happen?

Mum.
Why, me goes into a shop, and me asks for a pair of flesh silk stockings to be married in, de colour of mine leg, and instead of two, de man he send me one. Dam him all ober! for dis be no more de colour of my own leg den a guinea pig be like a canary.

Fatty.
Well, come, if you are disposed to be married, 'tis near twelve o'clock, and you can't be married after that, so let us proceed.

Mum.
Him stop a bit. -- I say, fader-in-law, I want to peak to you.

Fatty.
Well, what do you want?

Mum.
Me want to know what you give Mumbo Jumbo for making your daughter a colonel in the army?

Fatty.
What do you mean?

Mum.
Me mean to say -- what you will dub up?

Fatty.
Why, fifty pounds.

Mum.
Me never trust nobody -- gib me de money?

Fatty.
There then; and now I suppose you love my daughter more?

Mum.
Iss, a good deal; and if you gib me fifty pounds more, me will love her better.

Belph.
Come, Mumbo, let us make haste; I want to be married, and I can't wait any longer.

Fatty.
And see, here comes the holy priest to hasten us; what can have brought him here?

Mum.
De smell of de ducks dat I've got roasting for de weding dinner.

Enter Rob the Rhymer , disguised as a Monk, 1 E. R. H.

Rob.
Is there not an infatuated couple here anxious to enter into the holy state?

Belph.
Yes, if you please, father -- very anxious.

Rob.
And can you possibly give your hand to such a dirty little black boy as this individual?

Mum.
Here be language, on his wedding day, for a colonel in de army! Me will tell you what, Mr. Parson, if you are impudent, me will see you at de debble first before me pay de tithe.

Belph.
Oh, mind what you are saying, or he won't marry us at all, Mumbo Jumbo.

Mum.
Me don't care two-pence -- me have got de fortune of fifty pounds, so me don't care veder he do or not.

Rob.
I marry you! I say, woman, did you not once promise to marry Rob the Rhymer?

Belph.
Yes, I believe I did; but I have altered my mind now, and -- 

Rob.
Oh, have you? Then behold that injured man before you!

Mum.
Oh, boder!

Belph.
What, Robert! and is it you, dear love? So come to my faithful arms.

Rob.
Away!

Belph.
Bless you! I knew you all the time.

Poor debble! my feeling it is such , dat I almost feel dat I could cry. I pity him so much .

SCENE V.

 -- Stone Chamber, or Hall of Justice in the City of Rhodes.

The Grand Master, Sir Avelon, Piers Malcolm , and Knights discovered.

Gr. M.
Brothers and assembled knights, we stand here to try, for treason against our state, a recreant named Sir Calidor; a dark and sinful deed has been done in the flesh, and by the arm of the flesh must it be expiated, Summon the prisoner in, good Piers Malcolm.

Sir P.
Sir Calidor of Rhodes, we summon thee before the Grand Master! Sir Calidor, come into court -- accused of treason!

Enter Sir Calidor, 1 E. R. H.

Sir Cal.
Who dares to couple the name of Sir Calidor with that foul word? Show me the man! set him before me, and if he quail not at my eagle glance, I am indeed what you all strive to prove me -- a traitor and a villain.

Enter Sir Glorian, 1 E. R. H.

Sir Glo.
Then look on me, for I am thy accuser!

Sir Cal.
Impossble! mine eyes deceive me! Thou the phantom, and not the real form of Glorian de Ribemont! the soul of honour, and the light of chivalry!

Sir Glo.
I am Sir Glorian in soul and substance! I am not changed, though thou art Calidor!

Sir Cal.
Degraded man, I pity thee!

Sir Glo.
I have no scorn for the man below contempt.

Sir Cal.
Nor I a sword to strike thee to my feet! Mistaken man, thy aim is as clear as the noon day sun! Grant that thy falsehood find belief, that I bow my neck to the axe and perish, would Clarice de Beriot love thee better, because you freed my spirit earlier from its bonds of clay and gave me to the gaping grave before my course was run! No, no, Clarice de Beriot will never lock in wedlock's bands her hand with that which has been red with murder.

Sir Ave.
Malefactor, speak of my daughter as a stranger! 'Tis hard for a sire to hear her name polluted by the tongue of a villain!

Sir Cal.
Sir Avelon de Beriot is a man without a heart! A judge without humanity, should never be a judge, though some cold-blooded sons of the law there are who would rather use the gibbet and the axe than the sword of mercy. Glorian de Ribemout, you called yourself my accuser -- fellow, be brief and put your falsehoods into words, that I may hear the lie!

Gr, M.
This is but idle talk. Speak, the accuser.

Sir Glo.
Good knights and gentlemen, I would rather have died on the day that I was born than be the accuser of Sir Calidor, or doing that which I am doing now -- my duty. Of treason I arraign him, and this the proof: I saw him with these eyes in the tent of Kehama, the Saracen, consent, on the offer of a purse of gold, to betray this city and its brave defenders.

Gr. M.
Say, Calidor, is this thing so?

Sir Cal.
That for a moment I gave a seeming consent, I'll not deny; but that in the event I spurned the bribe, be witness, Heaven!

Gr. M.
Hast thou no other witness?

Sir Cal.
None.

Enter Clarice, 1 E. L. H.

Clar.
You have, you have! for I will be a witness for thy truth! 
(embracing.) 

Sir Ave.
Daughter, away! Twine not thy arms around the neck of a felon!

Clar.
I will not away! I will stand as a rooted tree to the spot, till the innocence of Calidor be made as clear and pure as the love I bear him!

Sir Ave.
Soldiers, remove that maniac!

Clar.
Touch me at your peril! There was a villain who went to the tent of the Saracen, and told his guilt before a veiled woman. You look pale! Fear not, I dare not tell the world who the villain was, though you may guess, perhaps, as well as I do!

Sir Ave.
What mean you?

Clar.
To strike an ice-bolt to your heart, I was the veiled woman!

Gr. M.
Your words, Clarice de Beriot, seem pregnant with some deep and hidden mystery. If thou hast aught to charge on any here, speak out -- if not, be silent.

Clar.
Blood is not water, and I cannot stay to see it spilt without a murmur.

Sir Ave.
Peace!

Clar.
I will not hold my peace!

Gr. M.
Beware, lest the love you bear to this, I fear me, this unhappy man, should cause you to forget the duty you owe your father.

Clar.
I will be silent, then -- that is, I will make the trial, for he, alas! he is my father.

Gr. M.
Your defence.

Sir Cal.
This lady knows my innocence.

Gr. M.
We cannot take her evidence; interested motives cannot be listened to -- so thy defence, or the headsman must perform his duty.

Sir Cal.
'Tis spoken in a word -- that I am innocent!

Gr. M.
Remove the prisoner to the death!

Clar.
Oh, say not so! say, say not that! You must not die, dear Calidor! die innocent!

Sir Cal.
Is it not better to die innocent than guilty? But I do confess me, it is hard to be cut off in my spring of love to thee, and to sink into the cold and silent grave, and leave a world thy beauty long may ornament. Clarice, Clarice! 'Tis not the loss of life that make me wait, it is the loss of thee!

Gr. M.
Young man, bear and forbear, is the motto of my cause. The unfortunate and innocent man takes sorrow, and even death, with true philosophy.

Sir Cal.
Ah, that reminds me of another task! take this letter -- I think you once lived in the vale of Arno, and knew a maid named Lilian of the Valley?

Gr. M.
What -- what of her?

Sir Cal.
You shall hear. When I first took to the trade of war she died, and on the day she died she gave me that letter, conjuring me by all that I held dear, that should I be in peril of my life by unjust accusation or secret slander, I should seek out the Grand Master of St. John, and give to him this paper.

Gr. M. (reads paper) 
"On my dying bed I pardon my seducer -- thee; but by the love you have violated, succour and protect your child -- for Calidor is thy son!" My boy! my boy!

Sir Ave.
The headsman waits without with the axe!

Gr. M.
Thou croaking raven, peace! And must I lose thee now, so newly found? By Heaven! I have wandered over the world to repair the wrongs I did thyself and mother. but fruitless was my search.

Sir Cal.
A convent's gloom received her.

Gr. M.
Oh, agony! Knights of St. John, pity a father's sufferings! revoke the sentence just pronounced by me! shut not your ears to my pleading words, nor your hearts close up to pity! But no, I read your answers! your oaths to our order  -- your vows to Heaven! Calidor -- Calidor! 
(embracing.) 

Sir Ave.
The headsman waits with the axe!

Enter Knight, 1 E. R. H.

Knight.
A Moresco has been arrested for strolling about the streets of Rhodes past curfew time, and when arrested, behaved to the soldiery with insolence.

Gr. M.
Bring him before us; I am still a judge, and will perform my duty. 
Enter Kehama as a slave, 1 E. R. H.

Now, sirrah! know you your crime?

Keh.
Yes; for walking about the streets and looking at the moon. But I should have found my way, gentlemen, here before, even if you had not sent for me.

Gr. M.
In what capacity?

Keh.
As a witness in the trial now before you.

Gr. M.
Know you aught of that?

Keh.
Yes, on that point, I and Sir Avelon de Beriot are better informed than most of you.

Sir Ave.
Are you mad?

Clar.
Speak -- speak, good fellow -- speak!

Keh.
I will, for I came on purpose. Sir Calidor is innocent! but the really guilty man -- 

Sir Ave.
Put a gag into his throat!

Sir Cal
Will no one pull that unjust judge from the judgment seat?

Keh.
Yes, I will! 
(seizes and casts down Sir Avelon .) 

Gr. M.
But the man of guilt -- who, who is he?

Keh.
The gentleman that I have put my foot upon!

Gr. M.
His crime?

Keh.
To poison the waters of the aqueduct, and send you all to the devil.

Sir Ave.
You must have further proof of this.

Keh.
Which will be found here! this poison in your breast -- 

Sir Ave.
That -- that is not poison.

Keh.
Will you drink it, to prove to the contrary!

Gr. M.
We must learn more of this from the lip of Kehama himself.

Keh.
And for this he came on purpose -- I am Kehama!

Sir Ave.
Lost and betrayed!

Gr. M.
The headsman waits without, Sir Avelon.

Sir Ave.
Hold and hear me! Had I succeeded in this great attempt, I would have sat upon a throne before I died; but, clambering up ambition's lofty ladder, I have failed -- am foiled and there's an end. You say the headsman waits! my blood was never doomed to flow upon a scaffold. Away, nor put a hand upon my garment! By his own sword --  
(stabs himself) 
 --  falls Sir Avelon de Beriot. Ha. ha!

 (Taken off R. H. 

Sir Cal.
Noble and gallant foe! How can I repay your kindness?

Keh.
If you survive the fight, by taking this fair lady unto wife -- no more. Though here within your walls I am your friend -- without, I am your foe. See me beyond them, or give me escort there, and when I reach the spot, a cannon shot shall tell the war begins.

Gr. M.
It shall be so. Heaven prosper the warrior's sword of good St. John!

Keh.
Alla and the Prophet nerve this right arm to wield the scimetar!

 [Exit. 1 E. R. H. 

Sir Cal.
Father, thy blessing.

Gr. M.
Long lost, but now restored, bless thee, my children! bless thee!

Sir Cal.
Hark! the distant march grows distant -- and more distant still! 
(gun fires.) 
It is the cannon shot! To arms! it is the signal!

Clar.
Think of me in the battle, Calidor.

Sir Cal.
Do not unman me now.

Clar.
Farewell!

 [Exit. 

Enter Knight, 1 E. L. H.

Knight.
The enemy approach the walls in countless myriads!

Sir Cal.
Sound all the clamorous instruments of war! draw your bright swords, nor sheathe them till the crumbling battlements of Rhodes bury us all in one great monument, or victory plants upon our brows the wreath of glory! For the knights of St. John of Jerusalem! for honour, and for Christendom!
