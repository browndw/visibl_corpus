ACT I.

SCENE I.

-- Entrance Hall of the Waterloo Hotel, Liverpool -- Table -- chairs -- newspapers -- handbells -- All discovered except Tidy -- CHAMBERMAID dusting table and chairs -- HOUSEMAID sweeping floor with hair-broom -- WAITER wiping decanter with napkin; Ditto, cleaning candlestick; Ditto, cleaning rummer, &c.

CHORUS.

Now hurry, hurry, hurry, 
Bustle quick about, 
The hotel fills with company, 

Enter TIDY, O. P.

I prithee, why this rout? 
Don't hurry, hurry, hurry, 
Nor bustle so about. 
Head Waiter am I, and I make it a rule, 
Be the house full or empty, to keep my head cool. 
Don't hurry, hurry, hurry, 
Nor kick up such a rout. 

Chorus. 
We'll make it a rule 
To keep our heads cool, 
Nor hurry, hurry, hurry, 
Nor kick up such a rout. 
[Exeunt all but Tidy, O. P. and P. S. 

Tidy.
Prosperity to the Waterloo Hotel, say I -- my great pride is to have everything in order. If master hadn't such a waiter as myself, the house would not do as it does. Who's this? 
(Looks off.) 
Mr. Ledger, the rum contractor -- he always comes to me for the news.

Enter LEDGER, P. S.

Led.
What ship is it that has just arrived, Tidy?

Tidy.
The William Thompson, sir, Captain Thompson, sir, from New York in twenty-one days.

Led.
Brisk passage -- you come from the New World to the Old one now-a-days, with more celerity than an active disorder would carry you out of this. Are any of your people at the pierhead? I expect a Yankee gentleman by this ship, who is going on to London.

Tidy.
No one landed yet, sir. 
(A bell rings, P. S. ) 
Excuse me a moment, sir, one of my numerous little children crying, I must go and stop its tongue.

[Exit O. P. 

Led.
What is the person's name I am to meet and to forward with letters of recommendation to London? 
(Takes out a letter, puts on spectecles.) 
"Mr. -- Mr. Jonathan W. Doubikins" -- The packets outsail each other so that I have but just received this notice of Jonathan's arrival from my old friend and correspondent, his uncle Ben. Let me see what does the American say! 
(Reads.) 
"To Mr. Ledger: -- Sir, per ship William Thompson, you will receive as per invoice three cwt. of best roll Virginia -- twenty barrels of yellow candle tallow, 34s. 6d., and one Nephew" -- Ha! ha! ha! bless his old mercantile soul! -- packing his nephew in the bill of parcels. 
(Reads.) 
"I wish Jonathan to see the world, so have sent him to the old country on a matter of business -- the lad thinks that if he writes his tour he may make a great advantage at the book stores at New York and Philadelphia -- I send the boy with a pretty considerable sight of dollars, and wish you to furnish him with letters along the line of road to London, where I have no doubt he will push his fortune, as he is a nation deal of the gentleman. -- Yours to command, Ben Harris ." Uncle Ben, I fear you have misjudged this matter a little -- well, I'll 'een trudge down to the pier-head and welcome this youth -- 

Doubikins. (Without, P. S. ) 
I'll take it a genuine favour if you'll tell me if this here's Waterloo Tavern?

Led.
What have we here, a newly-imported slave driver?

(Turns up stage, sits down, P. S. , puts on glasses, and reads newspaper.) 

Enter JONATHAN DOUBIKINS with a cigar, P. S.

Dou.
Bring in the plunder! 
(Plunder is luggage.) 
A pretty considerable cursed jolting I've had over the salt sea, I guess -- oh, Jonathan, Jonathan, you'd a better a staid at home with your mother, brother Josiah, sister Deborah, cousin Jemima, poor little Aminadab, and the rest; not forgetting old granny, bent somewheres about half double -- I'm dispurd sick of being in strange parts, tho' I han't put my foot ashore five minutes -- I wish I was at hum again -- I know I do -- 

Led. (Aside.) 
This vulgar fellow is some Captain Cook's steward's clerk!

(Ledger retires up stage.) 

Dou.
Well, so I suppose this here is Liverpool! it's a fool to New York, I guess, tho' I haven't been ashore five minutes! I'm ready to swound, slick right away -- I'll thank some un for a small grain of whiskey, or toddy, or sangery. This here's the Waterloo Tavern -- I see never a bar to it -- 
(Takes up a book and pencil.) 
I'll lose no time in beginning my remarks on the state of the British nation -- I've done the title page already -- "Remarks on the state of the British nation, by Jonathan W. Doubikins, United States" -- no bar, eh! 
(Writes.) 
"The taverns in the British nation, haven't got no bars" -- query, where the devil do they sarve their lickers then? O Jonathan, Jonathan W.!

Led.
Jonathan W. I beg pardon, sir, are you Mr. Jonathan W. Doubikins?

Dou.
Oh yes.

Led. (Coming forward.) 
A thousand pardons, my dear sir, that I should have so mistaken. So you are the nephew of my old friend Ben. I'm heartily glad to see you in England.

Dou. (Aside.) 
Wait till my book is published, and then you'll wish me at the devil.

Led.
Well, Mr. Doubikins, how do you go on in America?

Dou.
We go on in the steam vessels principally, I guess.

Led.
May I make free to ask in what part you were born?

Dou.
You know where Newhaven is?

Led.
Yes.

Dou.
Well, it wasn't there.

Led.
Why did you ask the question then?

Dou.
Because my Uncle Ben was raised -- 

Led.
Raised! oh born -- 

Dou.
Aye, you think you're right, I guess -- no brought up -- I was raised -- sumwheres in Varmount State -- all along shore there.

Led.
How did you get here?

Dou.
By water. Do you think I cum to an island by land?

Led.
What brought you?

Dou.
A vessel -- a desperate pull to swim 3,000 miles.

Led.
I mean the name of the vessel -- was it the Columbia?

Dou.
No, but we passed the Columbia two or three times in the passage -- we signalized her -- we put up our signal, and she put up hers. I came in the William Thompson, I guess, and she was plaguy full of live stock.

Led.
Oh, her lading.

Dou.
Yes, horses, cattle, hogs, passengers, and hop poles, with divers bale goods, sitch as buckets, pails, and sugar boxes, bread stuff, and a variety of leetle notions too tedious to mention -- notions among which were inions, parsnips, mousetraps, butter, candles, soap, and ile.

Led.
Ha, ha, ha, a singularly well assorted cargo. Had you a comfortable passage?

Dou.
I don't know, niver having tried it before.

Led.
A little raw, eh?

Dou.
I'm a leetle raw. Why I guess I be as one may say, humanly speaking , a leetle raw, for I never was roasted yit. I don't know how soon I may be; it was only tawk! he's roiling at me, but if you poke your fun at me, I poke again.

Led.
I perceive you are a clever fellow -- like your face.

Dou.
I'm glad you do, I wish I could return the compliment.

Led. (Aside.) 
Impertinent Yankee! Well, sir, you require of me I believe, a letter of recommendation to London. I have a friend and agent there, one Sir Leatherlip Grossfeeder.

Dou.
Is he an influential man?

Led.
A man of some weight in the city.

Dou.
Pray, sir, what may his weight be?

Led.
One hundred thousand pounds.

Dou. (Aside.) 
Weigh one hundred thousand pounds. I guess he's flinging his fun at me -- one hundred thousand pounds -- that a fat un, but I'll roil him. 
(Aloud.) 
Are you sure now?

Led.
Positive -- there are many of that weight in London.

Dou. (Takes his book out, writes.) 
"Mem: Unless the Liverpool people tell taradiddles, the Londoners weigh one hundred thousand pounds each." That is the most wonderful thing in my book yet; thank ye for the information; I see you've no pride, nor a bit of the gentleman about you.

Led. (Aside.) 
Saucy fellow, 
(Aloud.) 
I will just step into a room here, and just write you the letter. Adieu, for the present, Mr. Jonathan.

Dou.
Jonathan W. , if you please. I was christened Jonathan W , but they call me Jonathan for short -- you being a stranger -- but that's rather too familiar for you at first sight, I calculate.

Led.
Adieu, Mr. Jonathan W.

[Exit Ledger, O. P. 

Dou.
Here, landlord! landlord -- 
Enter TIDY, O. P.

How are you? You're the landlord? give me a chair!

Tidy.
No, sir, head waiter.

Dou.
Little chap -- head waiter -- not tall enough to tie my tail, I calculate. D'ye hear? I'm just come from Varmount State, and all along shore there. I'm pretty plaguily tired trampoosing the Atlantic -- give me a chair!

Tidy.
Shall I show you to a room, sir?

Dou.
Why, this is a room, isn't it? this will do well enough for me, till I goes to bed. Let me make an inquiry of you -- I'll ax you a bit of a question, if there's nobody agin it?

Tidy.
Well, sir.

Dou.
Is your boss a member of Congress?

Tidy.
My boss, sir? I don't comprehend -- 

Dou.
Come, none of your gum -- now you are but an underlin', tho' you are so uppish and twistical -- where's the chair?

Tidy.
Here's a chair, sir. 
(Brings it from P. S. of table. Dou. Sits.) 
Pretty particular, damn'd considerable uncomfortable chair I ever sat on. -- Hav'nt you one with a rocker?

Tidy.
These are the only chairs we use, sir.

Dou.
Are you sartin sure of that?

Tidy.
Yes, sir.

Dou.
Well, never mind. I'll get on with my remarks on the British Nation. 
(Sits, and writes.) 
"No comfortable chairs throughout the whole Kingdom of England." There's rather a slap for them, the sarpents!

Tidy.
You will doubtless excuse me taking the liberty, sir, but there is no smoking allowed in the Waterloo Hotel.

Dou.
Oh! the dickens -- I'm stunded!

Tidy.
It is considered a filthy custom, more honoured in the breach than the observance -- this hotel is remarkably clean.

Dou. (Writes.) 
"No tobacco allowed in England." There -- 
(Shuts book.) 
put that in your pipe and smoke it. There's another slap at 'em!

(Doubikins continues with a cigar in his mouth.) 

Tidy.
You still have got the cigar, sir!

Dou.
Oh, yes. I'm like the Fultem steamboat, I can't go on without smoking, I guess -- and who are you?

Tidy.
I am Tidy.

Dou.
Tidy, oh! Tidy! that's information. 
(Takes his book and writes.) 
"All the head waiters in England are called Tidys." Have you seen my help -- my nigger?

Tidy.
Sir.

Dou.
Agamemnon, my nigger! couldn't get any fool to buy him in America, so my Uncle Ben told me I'd better go try and sell him in England.

Tidy.
Sell him in England, sir -- ha! ha! ha!

Dou.
Now what are you grinning at?

Tidy.
I think, sir, your Uncle Ben has deceived you a little.

Dou.
Tarnation! that Uncle Ben, he always doos -- sit down a bit, and I'll tell you.

Tidy.
Who -- me, sir? 'tis not customary.

Dou.
There was that ar leetle trifle -- I never got that ar leetle trifle, for climbing up for the squirrel, up to this moment -- did you ever hear me tell that story.

(Jonathan begins relating an American story (ad lib.) and on raising his arm, a voice, O. P. , calls, " Waiter! Waiter! " 

Dou.
Now where is that rascal? Agamemnon, why the devil did I trouble myself to bring him over here -- all he had to do aboard was to take care of a live turtle, which I shall make something considerable of, I guess, when I get it up to London.

Agamemnon. (Without, P. S. ) 

Possum up a gum-tree 
Up he goes -- up he go 
Racoon in de hollow, 
Down below, down below! 

Dou.
Here he comes -- singing just as he did at Natchitoches. 
(Repeats verse, "Possum up a gum-tree, &c.") 

Enter AGAMEMNON in a sailor's jacket, with a turtle on his head, P. S.

You've been a pretty length of time, I calculate, nigger?

Aga.
Yes, massa -- piccaninny boys top to look at turtle -- he acquaint wid everybody -- he nod his head at dem -- see, massa, he know you agen.

(Turtle's head shakes.) 

Dou.
Nigger -- you know I am massiful, and have a genuine kind nater -- but I'll larrup you till you can't stand, if you hang chattering and stickling behind after this fashion -- what is to becum of you in these foreign parts, nigger?

Aga.
Me don't know, massa -- me don't care -- anythink better dan work.

Dou.
There, put down the turtle.

Aga.
Yes, massa -- I say, Massa Jontan -- when we make a soup of him? He, my friend in de voyage -- and I tell him all de way we came dat we going to make soup of him; he only shake him head and say noting.

Dou.
Agamemnon would do for an active spry help here at this Waterloo Hotel. What shall I take for the nigger? it hurts my feelings to part with him -- but damn it, I want the dollars, and perhaps he may get a boss that won't thump him so much as I have done. Uncle Ben leathered him pretty particular considerably deal more than I did tho'.

Re-enter LEDGER , with a letter, O. P.

Led.
Here's your letter of recommendation, sir. 
(Aside.) 
One ought to ask the fellow home to one's house -- but my wife wouldn't thank me for such an introduction. This is addressed to my old friend, Sir Leatherlip Grossfeeder, near Birchin Lane, he will make a man of you.

Dou.
Make a man of me? The devil, I wonder what I was afore then?

Led.
What have we here?

Aga.
He be a turtle, massa -- big terrapin!

Led.
Terrapin! -- what's a terrapin?

Dou.
Humph! you know what a goose is?

Led.
Yes.

Dou.
Well, before it is a goose, it's a goslin, and a terrapin before it's turtle.

Led.
Aye, now I comprehend.

Dou.
Most of you do when things are explained to you.

Led.
If you would wish to win my friend, the alderman's heart, take up that fine lively creature, Mr. Doubikins, to London with you.

Dou.
What fine lively creature?

Led. (Pointing towards the turtle.) 
That?

Dou. (Aside.) 
He means Agamemnon.

Led.
Is he fat?

Dou.
Oh, yes; -- don't you see?

(Alluding to Agamemnon.) 

Led.
Green fat?

Dou.
No, black as ink.

Led.
Black fat! very extraordinary!

Dou.
Not in the least, there are a great number of them fine lively creatures, male and female dancing about on a Sunday afternoon, when meeting is over.

Led.
My friend, the alderman, will eat every bit of him!

Dou.
Why, this is worser than the wild savages at Shawanac. 
(Aside.) 
But I've some doubts about selling Aggy to be devoured. Oh, yes! do you calculate he will be eaten?

Led.
I've not the least doubt of it. London aldermen are not very fastidious on those points.

Dou. (Writes.) 
I'll put it down, "London aldermen will eat a nigger."

Led.
What are you putting down there in black and white?

Dou.
Something about the blacks and whites tew , I guess -- I'm madded, but I'll bite in my breath a bit -- not that I'm sitch a tarnation fool as to believe all you tell me.

Led.
Sir!

Dou.
I'm not such a beast as to believe in all disbeliefs -- I'd rather be in rags than feel my blud bile so, or go through the world stark naked than be imposed on.

Led.
Imposed on?

Don.
Oh, yes! -- imposed on -- here mister, here's flesh and blud as fairn as yourn, and under it a good piece of pluck, about as big as a bullock's heart -- that don't fear the face of day -- now that's for you, mister; and let me tell you I don't think much of you as a Great Britainer!

Led.
What the devil puts you in such a passion, sir?

Dou.
None of your flouting, by jumping jigs, I won't stand it -- we Americans have got hard heads -- we warn't brought up in the woods to be scart at by an owl -- you can't scare me so, nor make me not love my country -- with all its forts. It's finer, bigger, more abundant, larger and more like a world, and a nation deal better than any other I know'd on.

Led.
Who the plague said a word about your country? -- you mistake.

Dou.
I don't mistake, you mistake yourself -- you've got the wrong sow by the ear -- give it up, make an apology if you find me an over match -- I'm a free-born American -- father was a free-born American -- Uncle Ben was a free-born American -- and won't I stand by 'em tu -- stiff as a poker -- oh, yes!

Led.
Oh, yes. 
(Mimicking.) 
What is all this rage about?

Dou.
Don't you stick your bristles up high to make me sing small.

Led.
My bristles? nobody intended to impose on you -- I only meant -- 

Dou.
I don't care your meaning -- I know what I du mean.

Led.
Sir, you are not reasonable.

Dou.
I guess I ben't -- I'm glad I ben't; and I don't incline to , and so now, when everything mads me so -- 

Led.
Since you are inclined to forget the respect due to a gentleman -- good day, sir.

[Exit P. S. 

Dou.
An awful desperate, gawky kind of fellow -- telling me a parcel of lies -- he madded me -- he's crusty -- short as pie crust -- techy! -- jurk, jurk, snap or go. 
(Takes his book out and writes.) 
"The English people are so passionate, that they do not mind offending their best friends," -- a pretty considerably darned out of the way beginning I've made in this country, and you, you great stick of black liquorice -- you great round piece of black spermacetti -- to stand by and hear your boss abused.

(Strikes him.) 

Aga.
Oh, cuss -- Massa Jontan -- send me to the plenipumtentiary again, but don't beata me.

(Cries.) 

Enter TIDY and Waiters, O. P.

Tidy.
It is totally impossible that you can stay here making this noise -- you must quit the hotel.

Dou.
What?

Tidy.
You must retire.

Dou.
Du you call this a land of liberty, where I cannot larrup my own nigger without being ordered out of the house? du explain to me the principles of the British constitution! Here, you Tidy, what will you give me for this black?

Tidy.
Give you, sir?

Dou.
Yes, he is mine, you Tidy.

Aga.
Please to buy me, you Tidy -- me berry good nigger -- I can fiddle like nightingale!

Tidy.
You appear quite strange to our customs, sir.

Dou.
Your customs have got all my trunks and baggage -- pretty considerable awful beginning, I guess, for quite a stranger -- have you niver a pony that I might swop with you for the nigger.

Tidy.
You had better take yourself and nigger out of the hotel, sir -- you will find an inn at the outskirts of the town, on the London Road, which will better suit your purpose -- allow me, sir, to show you the door.

Dou.
I can see the door, without you showing, I guess. I won't budge if I han't a mind to -- don't think to captivate me. -- If I don't tell my uncle Ben of this -- to be turned out by an underlin -- a help -- a sarvant -- a sarvant of sarvants is a slave to the devil! -- Come along you black scoundrel -- if I don't complain to Congress -- there'll be a war between the tu countries, and all on my account, oh, yes.

[Tidy and Waiters force out Doubikins and Agamemnon, P. S. 

SCENE II.

-- Outside of a Small Inn -- The Greyhound.

Enter NATTY LARKSPUR from P. S.

Nat.
Oh, dear, dear, what a life I lead, everything goes wrong -- ostler, post-boy, boots, underwaiter, pots -- work, work, from morning to night -- Natty, you rascal, here -- rub down that pair of horses -- Natty, you vagabond, kill that pair of ducks -- Natty, you rapscallion, mop the wheels of that chay -- Natty, you idle villain, come and take this rat out of the trap.

Mrs. Lemon. (Without.) 
Natty, you ragamuffin!

Nat.
There, now she calls me a ragamuffin. 
(Cries.) 
Oh -- I'll speak insinuatingly, though -- I'm here, mistress.

Mrs. Lemon. (Pops her head on but withdraws.) 
I don't want you.

Nat.
Thank'ye for nothing then -- I wish I could run away -- I don't get enough wages to keep soul and body together -- I'm wasted till I've got no waist. -- I was a nice little fat fellow when I was hired to starve here, for to live is the wrong word for it.

Jemmy. (Within.) 
Natty!

Nat.
Yes -- there's my twin brother, fellow-servant and sufferer. If I'm half starved, he is quite, poor little fellow.

Enter JEMMY, P. S.

Jem.
Natty!

Nat.
Well, boy.

Jem.
This won't do -- our master is a miser -- our mistress is a she miser, they have been trying the experiment of how little servants can exist on -- sign of bad times -- I feel like our sign, the Greyhound.

Nat. (Weeps.) 
I'm sorry to see you look so like one, brother; everything goes wrong -- there's the plaguy old cow too gone dry -- they set me to milk her, but in vain -- I go pull, pull, pull, for half-an-hour together -- but there's no effects.

Jem.
When I rides the grey mare, the people says "There goes Jemmy in a galloping consumption." If we starve now, what shall we do when we get old?

Nat.
We are twins, Jemmy, now I wonder which is the oldest?

Jem.
I don't know which was born first -- but I think I've been longest in the world.

Nat.
A po-chay driver don't mind old age, for he is a boy all his life.

Jem.
Let us kick for more wages.

Nat.
And get kicked for our pains.

Mrs. Lemon. (Within.) 
Jemmy -- Natty.

Jem.
There's mistress -- let us give her warning at once.

Enter MRS. LEMON from house in flat.

Mrs. L.
Hoity toity, now -- here are you two fellows idling when there are chickens to pick -- peas to shell -- ale to tap -- boots to clean -- bottles to wash -- carpets to beat -- floors to sand -- beans to split -- knives to grind, and kittens to drown; but it is my fate to be surrounded by lazy people.

Jem. (Apart to Natty.) 
You speak to her.

Nat.
No -- do you -- I'm afeard -- look at her eye -- it glistens like the tiger's in the carrywan.

Mrs. L.
Why don't you stir?

Nat.
Now give her warning -- 

Jem.
You -- mun -- you -- 

(Each pushing the other forward.) 

Nat. (Faintly.) 
Please missis -- we are going away, mum -- 

Mrs. L.
Why don't you go then to your work?

Jem.
We are going away -- 

Nat. (Putting his hand to his chest.) 
I've been going away for the last six months.

Mrs. L.
What do the sorry varlets mean?

Nat.
We are sorry enough, and the horses are sorry too -- but we are going to go for all that.

Jem.
We haven't enough to eat -- nothing to drink, and no sleep -- we think if we stay here longer we shall die -- so -- so -- 

Nat.
So we can't live with you no longer, Mother Lemon!

Mrs. L.
Mother Lemon! do my eyes and ears deceive me -- do you dare to give me warning -- I'll go and tell your master, and he shall come and trim your jackets right well. Mr. Lemon -- Mr. Lemon -- you are wanted.

[Exit into house. 

Jem.
Don't you think we had better run for it?

Nat.
No -- let's stop and get our wages first.

Jem.
Natty, we will start by the coach in the morning -- go you to London -- and get a place. Mr. Ledger, the merchant, promised you a letter of recommendation as postillion to an alderman -- and -- I -- will throw myself on the wide world.

Nat.
You are long enough to lie all across it.

Jem.
Natty, this is no time for joking! we can't start without some provisions -- I'm above doing a dirty action, but if I don't rob the larder to-night for a dinner on the road my name is not James Larkspur.

Nat.
But it is always locked up, by that she griffin with a bunch of keys -- 

Jem.
Nat, you know the bed-room at the back of the larder?

Nat.
Yes -- the one they always put the shy customers in to sleep over the kitchen.

Jem.
I've found that a plank will come out of the back of the larder, and we can take what victuals we like.

Nat.
You found it out, so have I; but I never took nothing though -- but suppose anybody comes to bed there?

Jem.
We will wait till he's asleep -- and then -- Come into the hay-loft and talk further on this matter.

[Exit, O. P., 2 E. 

Nat.
There's hope of one meal, however -- I'm sure they kept me so close I shall make no bones of stealing it. -- If there isn't Mr. Ledger. I wonder if he's got the letter of recommendation he promised me to Lunnon.

Enter MR. LEDGER, O. P.

Led.
I've come a few yards out of the way, my lad, to give you this. It will most probably procure you the situation you desire in town. -- When do you go?

Nat.
I talks of going to night, sir -- thank you kindly.

Led.
Well, present my compliments to Sir Leatherlip Grossfeeder -- to whom this note is directed, and tell him I have sent him a pink of a postillion.

Nat.
A pig of a postillion, sir?

Led.
A pink -- a pink of a postillion -- no thanks, I'm in haste to get to the Waterloo Hotel -- I wish you success, Natty.

[Exit, P. S. 

Nat.
Thank ye, sir. Lord what a relief, I'll just go and take my best clothes out of pledge, and then up to town -- dear dear -- how I have suffered both in body and mind -- but in body particularly, for want of wittles.

SONG.

Good lauk! who a hungry postillion would be, 
Did they know half the misery suffered by me. 
Here and there, everywhere; I'm at each beck and call. 
And whatever I do -- 'tis for nothing at all. 
My stingy old master oft brings me to book, 
I'm waiter and boots, ostler, helper, and cook. 
I must wake while they sleep, must be dumb while they talk, 
While they eat I must starve, while they ride I must walk 
Poor Natty -- poor Natty. 
While they eat, &c. 

I ne'er get a belly full, save it's of blows 
And tho' oft over-burthened -- it isn't with clothes, 
Ill fed and worse taught -- still I must while I'm able, 
Kill the ducks, run on errands, clean knives, sweep the stable. 
Whatever wind blows, ill or well, smooth or fair, 
I do all that's to do, and bear all that's to bear; 
Yet, whatever I do, I get kicked, and that's flat 
And anything's good enough thought for poor Nat. 
Poor Natty -- poor Natty. 
And anything's good enough, &c. 
[Exit into house. 

SCENE III.

-- A room in the Greyhound -- the back of the closet visible -- A bed with curtains, bolster, table, chairs.

Enter MRS. LEMON with lighted candle, L. D. P. S.

Mrs. L.
A pretty pass matters are come to, when two impudent varlets venture to give me warning -- next, I suppose, they'll come to me for a character -- but I'll let them know I've no character to give them.

(Turning down bed-clothes and drawing curtains -- afterwards brings forward table and chair.) 

Enter NATTY, P. S.

Nat.
Ma'am?

Mrs. L.
Well, dolt.

Nat.
There are two persons below with some luggage -- it's very late, am I to let them in?

Mrs. L.
To be sure, fool -- what do they look like?

Nat.
Look like -- look like a game at draughts -- there's a black man and a white one!

Mrs. L.
I'll come down directly.

Nat.
They're coming up directly, it seems. 
(Looks off.) 
They said, or rather the white man said, they didn't want no supper, but the other man I thought looked very black about it.

[Exit P. S. , side door. 

Doubikins. (Without, P. S. ) 
Come along, Aggy.

Enter DOUBIKINS and AGAMEMNON bearing parcels, trunk, and portmanteau, side door, P. S.

Dou.
How d'ye do, ma'am. Tarnation, she's awful clever, and a pretty darned considerable mixture of red and white in her cheeks. If so be, ma'am, that I can keep here to-night -- 

Mrs. L.
Keep what, sir?

Dou.
No 'fence, I hope -- I mean if I can remain here all night.

Mrs. L.
What will you have for your supper, sir?

Dou.
Supper -- I guess I don't want supper. I'm not going to locate here, because d'ye see I don't intend to spend my dollars till I get up to London.

Mrs. L. (Aside.) 
Shabby fellow -- won't you take something to drink, sir?

Aga.
I will.

Dou.
Hold your tongue nigger -- no, ma'am, I'm obleeged. 
(Apart.) 
I may gain a little information from this landlady, afore I go to bed, to write in my book. I'll ax you a question if you're not agin it.

Mrs. L.
Sir -- I -- 

Dou.
What is your opinion of the society of England?

Mrs. L.
Society -- sir?

Dou.
Yes, ma'am, genteel society, or mixed society.

Mrs. L.
Oh, in this house we call it genteel society when they order wine , and it is mixed society when they order spirits and water.

Dou.
Thank ye, ma'am, I'll put that all down. "Genteel society drink wine, mixed society sperrits and water."

Mrs. L.
But when they order nothing at all -- 

Dou.
What then, du pray tell?

Mrs. L.
Not fit for any society whatever.

Dou.
Hem! I shan't enter that -- is this to be my sleeping room?

Mrs. L.
This is your bed-chamber if you choose, sir. 
(Aside.) 
It is the worst in the house -- at the back of the larder and over the kitchen; but it is good enough for such a paltry chap. Does that black gentleman want a bed, sir?

Dou.
That black gentleman. 
(Doubikins laughs, and afterwards Aggy.) 
Gentleman nigger! ha! ha! ha! I saw a nation nice place below for the black gentleman to sleep in -- the water trough -- I guess this black gentleman never slept in a bed in his life.

Aga.
Neber -- always sleep on de ground -- will you buy me, ma'am?

Mrs. L.
What -- a Hottenpot, buy him indeed. 
(Aside.) 
I don't half like these people -- I've my suspicions they are no better than they should be. Natty, bring a bootjack.

[Exit P. S. , side door. 

Dou.
That woman has a considerable amount of gumption about her -- a most extrumpery conversation; now it will be as well to take care of my dollars and notes in this strange land. 
(Feeling his pockets.) 
I won't trust anybody; I'll be bound there's a pretty set of thieves in this part of the world.

(Takes his money out.) 

Enter NATTY with boot-jack -- looks at Doubikins, side D. P. S.

Dou.
How that fellow eyes my notes!

Nat. (Aside.) 
Come, he has got some money tho'!

Dou.
I don't like that look at my dollars. -- Leave your boot-jack, and be off! 
(They look suspiciously and sheepishly at each other. -- Natty goes out P. S. side door.) 
Now nigger -- 

Aga.
Massa, I'm berry sleepy. 
(Lies on the floor.) 
Me dream of my love, Miss Diana.

Dou.
You keep awake! be watchful as a Cerberus, to guard your boss.

Aga. (Mutters.) 
Me as soon guard the debble -- I know dat -- 

Dou.
Silence!

Aga.
If I don't talk or sing, massa, I shall go sleep.

"Possum up a gum tree, 
Up he go, up he go." 

Dou.
Lie still and be quiet, or I shall be hectored out of this tavern, as I was out of the other. 
(Sits down at table.) 
Turn me out of their hotel for larruping you! Is this a land of liberty? I, a free-born American, and as likely a person, I judge, as enny I know of! 
(Takes his book, writes.) 
"The English folk are a parcel of highty-tighty, mighty, flighty fellows!"

Aga. (Half a sleep, sings.) 

"Possum up a gum tree, 
Up he go, up he go." 

Dou.
What was that? I heard a noise!

Aga. (Half asleep, singing.) 

"Racoon in de hollow, 
Down below, down below." 
(Finishing song.) 

Dou. (Throws the boot-jack at Agamemnon.) 
Will that silence you?

Aga.
Quite good, massa! quite, made a great bump on my head.

Dob. (Writes.) 
"Mem: -- English boot-jacks good things to quiet noisy niggers." Now to empty my pockets. Here are my notes, here my note book, and here Mr. Ledger's letter of recommendation. 
(Places letter on table.) 
Aggy lies as quiet as the king at nine pins, when he is knocked down. -- As the Lunnun coach will call in a couple of hours, I won't take my clus off, I calculate. I'll lie on the bed, and try to get a mouthful of sleep. 
(Goes to door.) 
No lock on the door! I didn't like that little chap's looks at my notes at all. No matter, if they should try to rob me, my nigger is here -- but he sleeps so sound, a cannon wouldn't wake him!

(Takes off his hat and coat, puts on a night-cap. -- Sings, half alarmed.) 

"Let what will cum, it shall be borne, 
I will not cry and snivel, 
I'd better have my breeches torn, 
Then dealings wtth the devil. 
Yankee doodle keep it up 
Yankee doodle dandy, 
Yankee doodle mind the step, 
And with the gals be handy." 
(Looks round the room -- gets on the bed -- draws curtain -- a pause -- door opens very gently -- shuts again -- Doubikins puts his head out between the curtains -- in an under voice, exclaims, " What was that ?" Agamemnon snores. " Aggy snoring, I reckon on -- he draws the air thro' his black nostrils like the wind whistling thro' a back chimney ." Draws curtain -- Door again opens -- Enter NATTY , softly -- blows out the candle, and hides behind the table -- Stage darkened -- Float only.) 

Nat. (Whispers.) 
He is asleep.

Dou. (Peeps out.) 
Hey! railly?

Nat.
It is all right, I'll have it now.

Dou. (Trembling, apart.) 
Have what?

Nat.
Here's the knife -- I'll do it so quietly, that it shall not wake him.

Dou. (Apart.) 
Knife! oh, the dickens!

Nat.
How devilish suspicious he looked when I saw him with the notes in his hand.

Dou. (Aside.) 
It is all over with me, I guess!

Nat.
There's my bundle, it has taken all my ready cash to get these things out of pawn from my uncle.

Dou.
He knows Uncle Ben.

(Lays letter and bundle on table.) 

Nat.
I mustn't lose Mr. Ledger's letter -- there.

Dou.
Mr. Ledger's letter?

Nat,
Now for the good stuff -- I'll just take enough to keep us comfortable till we get to London.

Dou.
Oh, my dollars!

Nat.
I wish I had not put the light out, it's as dark as a mourning coach.

Dou. (Apart.) 
Mourning coach -- what is he after?

Nat.
There's the great blackamoor on the floor. 
(Forces out lower plank.) 
There's one down -- here he is! 
(Discovers a round of beef.) 
I'll cut such a piece of fat out of him.

Dou.
Cut a piece of fat out of poor Aggy? what's to be done? They are going to kill him first!

Nat. (Breathless.) 
What was that? Hush! 'pon my life, I do think if the lodger was to wake, in my fright I should run this carving knife up to the hilt in him. Now, then, I'll load.

(Doubikins withdraws his head.) 

Dou. (Reappears, apart.) 
Load pistols, eh?

Nat.
Here's plenty of all sorts of good things -- here's some forced balls.

Dou.
Balls?

Nat.
Two or three of these sent into an empty stomach, now -- 

Dou.
They know I haven't had my supper.

Nat.
Now, I'll do the job at once.

(Whets knife -- Doubikins looks out in alarm.) 

Dou.
I'll sell my life dearly.

(Sits up in bed with the bolster -- Natty is cutting the beef.) 

Nat.
If old Mother Lemon could see us now!

(A crash -- Dishes fall.) 

Dou.
Help! help! help! -- Murder!

( MRS. LEMON appears through the hole in the larder with a light.) 

Mrs. L.
What have we here -- what's the matter?

(Natty runs to the table, takes up his bundle, and the letter that Doubikins put on the table -- Natty skulks off at the side.) 

Dou.
Help! help! -- That nigger would not wake if the roof was falling in. Help! help! -- good Christians -- help! Agamemnon -- and be darned to you!

Mrs. L.
Are there thieves in the house?

(Lemon disappears from larder.) 

Dou.
Oh, yes -- my dollars are safe -- here's a cursed country -- I shall have my throat cut -- help! -- murder! -- help!

(Runs about in his night-cap with the bolster, alarmed.) 

Mrs. L. (Without, side door, P. S. ) 
Can I come in, sir?

Dou.
Oh, yes -- I am quite dacent.

Mrs. L.
What in the name of goodness is all this?

Dou.
That is what I want to know.

Mrs. L.
Your filthy black has broken the back of my larder open.

Dou.
My black sleeps like a cockroach, I guess.

Mrs. L.
Cockroach or not -- here's my round of beef in his arms.

Dou.
I scorn your insinuations -- I'll leave your house directly -- you're a she captain of banditti, as I've heard of in foreign countries. 
(Goes to the table, takes up letter.) 
Why, my letter of recommendation looks as if it had grown shorter. -- 
(Reads direction.) 
"To Sir Leatherlip Grossfeeder." No, it is all right -- I'll quit your tavern. 
(Horn without. -- Voice without, "London coach." 
The Lunnun coach -- then I'm off. Wake, Aggy, wake.

(Kicks him.) 

(Passengers with luggage, &c., pass across stage -- seen from the opening behind the pantry -- Key'd bugle, supposed to be from the guard of the coach, plays symphony to, and accompanies the finale. -- Several voices without.)

END OF ACT I.

ACT II.

SCENE I.

-- An apartment in the house of Sir Leatherlip Grossfeeder. -- Table, chairs, books. -- MARY discovered reading, P. S.

Mary.
In vain I endeavour to direct my attention -- the dark eye and manly form of my beloved William are ever before me, and he can never be mine. My uncle and aunt have prohibited the match with a man of sense, spirit, and generosity, for no other reason than a prejudice to his native country America, and have left their poor Mary to deplore in fruitless sighs her unhappy passion.

Enter PATTY, O. P.

Pat.
Oh, ma'am! who do you think is below? Mr. Delapierre, ma'am.

Mary.
Alas, Patty! I dare not see him, your master and mistress have strictly forbidden it.

Pat.
La! ma'am, they won't know any better if he comes up. Sir Leatherlip Grossfeeder has not returned from his water party, and my lady is locked up with her chemistry -- do let Mr. Delapierre come, if it's only for five minutes.

Mary.
Ah, Patty, I'm afraid I cannot deny your request, therefore hasten to inform Mr. Delapierre that he shall be admitted. 
[Exit Patty, O. P. 
If I am wrong, love must plead my excuse. How little will age allow for the warmth of an early passion. Delapierre, your pure and ardent affection has been the joy of my life.

SONG.

I changed me with his changing mood, 
I soothed his mind to rest. 
The music of his solitude, 
The breeze that fann'd his breast. 
It was the first of happy dreams, 
That made his sleep so sweet, 
The earliest of the morning beams, 
His waking eyes to meet. 
(Re-enter PATTY introducing DELAPIERRE, O. P. -- Exit Patty, O. P. 

Del.
My sweet Mary, I have ventured once more on forbidden ground, to inform you that I yesterday made another attempt to intercede with your uncle in my behalf, but was repulsed with insult.

Mary.
Insult! my dear William?

Del.
Sir Leatherlip told me he would not listen to my offers, as he detested the very name of an American; he insinuated that my sole view was upon your fortune, which you know, is placed in the public funds of my country.

Mary.
An ungenerous reflection on the most honourable intentions. My uncle is well aware that your estate and possessions doubly exceed mine.

Del.
I have too much of my native independence not to be proud, yet I dare not marry without your uncle's consent. -- I cannot lay myself at the feet of insolent prosperity -- I should indeed deserve to be spurned.

Mary.
Dear William, what is to be done?

Del.
Patience must, I believe, be our resource. Fate may perhaps grant an opportunity of proving to your guardian my real views, but should I lose my Mary -- 

Mary.
Never! William! -- never!

[Exeunt O. P. 

SCENE II.

-- Parlour at Sir Leatherlip Grossfeeder's -- table with books, chemical apparatus, gasometer.

Enter LADY GROSSFEEDER, C., PATTY P. S.

Lady G.
Patty, give me the last lecture -- has the tenth number of the Mechanics' Magazine come in yet?

Pat.
It does not come out till Saturday -- oh, my lady, the powdered gentleman with all the gashes bottled up called this morning, but I told him you were engaged.

Lady G.
And why didn't you let me see him?

Pat.
Because, ma'am, it was just at the time that Mr. Handle Lever was trying his experiment on your ladyship with the new patent air-pump.

Sir L. (Within, P. S. ) 
Where's my lady?

Pat.
Here's master, ma'am, just come home from the swan-hopping.

Lady G.
Patty, say another time, the Aquatic Excursion, swan-hopping is not a pretty word. Carry that vial of steel-filings to my closet; take care don't go near the gasometer for the world; you frighten me out of my wits for fear of an accident.

Pat.
I'll take care, ma'am.

[Exit with vial, O. P. 

Sir Leatherlip. (Without P. S. ) 
No, I'll empty my pockets up stairs. 
(Enters P. S. ) 
Ah! my lady, my lady, we have had a gloriously pleasant day -- started at ten in the twenty-oared gilded barge -- breakfasted at eleven -- heavenly day -- on board hot rolls kept warm in blankets -- hundreds of plovers' eggs -- silver Thames. The fish began to swim after us before we had got through Blackfriars Bridge.

Lady G.
The fish swam after you, Sir Leatherlip, that involves a new question in natural history.

Sir L.
No, no, my dear, not at all, not at all. We began to eat and drink the moment we got on board. Mr. Gargle the apothecary and I sat near the rudder, because we've been used to the water -- no effect on us -- so when he had eaten enough breakfast, Mr. Gargle the apothecary made little bread pills and threw them out to the gudgeons and flounders. I assure your ladyship it was quite rural.

Lady G.
Well, my love, you take pleasure in matters from which I could not distil a particle of delight.

Sir L.
Not at all -- glorious fun -- heavenly day -- a shower came on, so about one hundred and twenty-five of us were compelled to get into the state cabin -- and a pretty state we were in -- rain don't do for nankeens. Ladies very accommodating, sat in each others laps. The professional singers tied their handkerchiefs round their necks and sang -- 

"Ye gentlemen of England, who live at home at ease, 
"How little do you think upon the dangers of the seas." 

Lady G.
Very apropos.

Sir L.
Not at all. Then Mr. Curaçoa proposed a small glass of eau de vie all round. Gad! he had not any occasion to say it twice -- set everybody's tongue going; but it got very warm below! No matter -- determined to be cheerful -- so out I takes my telescope to observe the direction of the clouds, ha! ha! pulling it open thus, I knocked Mrs. Merchant Taylor's turban through the window into the water.

Lady G.
How vexatious.

Sir L.
Not at all. She laughed, and hoped if it floated to London Bridge, that it might be picked up and carried to her husband, it would make him a happy man for the rest of the day, as he would suppose his lady food for fishes, ha! ha!

Lady G.
You have been exceedingly merry.

Sir L.
Yes -- but we stopped at Isleworth for a supply of strawberries and cream, of which we all partook.

Lady G.
What a concatenation.

Sir L.
Not at all -- that was nothing; we lunched at Brentford, and at Richmond set down regularly to the turtle and iced punch -- venison and champagne for dinner.

Lady G.
How different are we. You are fond of the effervescence of champagne, I'm partial to the effervescence of wit.

Sir L.
Not at all, ha! ha! you shall hear the joke, ha! ha! Mr. Curmudgeon, senior, said an excellent thing just as the cloth was removed -- he made one of his comical faces, and said, "Thank Heaven, I have had a good dinner, and I don't care who ain't." Ha! ha! we all laughed for half-an-hour. I thought the ladies would have spilled their champagne with laughing. Oh! my lady, why will you have this hydrogen lamp here, it will break every window in the house. The man who brought it home said, that if any of the servants should put a light near it, it would go off with a louder explosion than any of the fireworks at Vauxhall. Well, I despatched that American lover of Miss Mary's, yesterday -- I cannot bring myself to like the Yankees -- not at all. 
Enter BUTLER , with letter, P. S.

Well?

But.
Here's a man with a letter, sir, he says he has travelled all night from Liverpool.

Sir L.
Liverpool -- famous for turtle! It is the handwriting of my old friend, Ledger. 
(Opens it.) 
I will do anything to oblige him, he is one of my most profitable agents. 
(Reads.) 
"Dear sir, -- The young man, Nathaniel Larkspur, who brings this letter, I can recommend as a super-excellent postillion, he has driven all sorts of horses in bad roads in this neighbourhood for some time." Oh! I asked Ledger to look out for me. Tell the young man to come up, and I'll see him alone. What sort of a looking person is it?

But.
A tall odd man, with a tail, sir; never stands still a moment.

Sir L.
Show him up. 
[Exit Butler, P. S. ] 
I hate a tall postillion, his legs always look as if they were under the wheels, and you can never enjoy the prospect over his head. He has a tail too, that will always be popping in at the front chaise window.

Doubikins. (Without, P. S. -- Sings.) 

Some say the devil's dead.
Up here -- oh yes, very well -- I can find the way, I reckon.

Enters, with his hat on, P. S.

Sir L. (Aside.) 
Tolerably easy.

Dou.
I guess you are Sir Leatherlip -- what's your other name, sir? -- and madam, there, your's obleeged.

Sir L.
Odd fellow, this. So, my friend -- 

Dou.
I'm not a Quaker, I reckon -- though you called me friend! Name things by their right names -- that's my maxim.

Sir L.
Strange! Mr. Ledger gave you this letter?

Dou.
I guess he did.

Sir L.
And he wishes me to employ you.

Dou.
That I don't know about, I calculate.

Sir L.
He is desirous that I should take you into my house.

Dou.
Well, I've no objections, provided it be agreeable to all parties.

Sir L.
You have been accustomed to horses?

Dou. (Apart.) 
What's he driving at? Oh, yes -- accustomed to horses, I ought to be, I guess -- there were ten horses in the hold coming over.

Sir L.
Ten horses to hold.

Dou.
I tell 'ee I hadn't to hold 'em -- what do you take me for?

Sir L.
I take you for that which your friend, Mr. Ledger, has pointed out, for he is a good friend to you, and recommends you warmly.

Dou.
Recommends me warmly?

Sir L.
Yes, and I'll talk to you further on the subject in half an hour -- you may go down below and sit by the fire.

Dou.
So as I'm recommended warmly; I'm to go down and sit by the fire -- but you'll come and sit wi' me?

Sir L.
I -- not at all.

Dou.
Pray do -- or madam there -- for it's nation lonesome to sit by one's self.

Lady G.
Well, this is the most out of the way person I ever met.

Dou.
Out of the way person! I've progressed a pretty considerable darn'd long way, ma'am.

Lady G. (Apart.) 
This man will never suit us. You appear much too blunt and independant for a menial situation.

Dou.
I hope I do appear so -- it is my intention to -- to always put the saddle on the right horse.

Sir L.
You must be more civil, or you will never put any saddles on my horses 
(Rings bell, P. S. ) 
-- but I can't offend Mr. Ledger by refusing you a trial, my man.

Don.
Trial! why what the devil have I committed?

Sir L.
You've committed yourself, I think -- 
(Enter PATTY, P. S. ) 
now that was not your bell Patty.

Dou.
Her bell! Now what does he mean by her bell -- oh, I know 
(Writes in his journal.) 
"In England, the women helps have bells like American sleigh horses."

Sir L.
Take this person into the butler's room, let him wait till I ring, -- there, follow that young woman.

Dou.
One of the things I never accustomed myself to.

Sir L.
What, sirrah?

Dou.
To follow the young women -- tho' I've sparked pretty often at hum with the Deacon's darter. Oh, yes, my lovyer is in America -- my heart is behind.

Sir L.
Very odd situation.

Lady G.
Do not let him relate his low amours here, Sir Leatherlip -- this man is too coarse, even for a postillion -- I shall retire to my study.

[Exit, O. P. 

Sir L.
What shall I do with him? Go below, Nathaniel!

Dou.
I wonder how low that is -- why the devil does he call me Nathaniel -- well, if I'm to go, I must go, but I don't at all see why I could not just as well let you enjoy my society here -- by the bye I'll tell you a story of my Uncle Ben.

(Begins relating story of Uncle Ben and the squirrel, ad. lib.) 

Sir L.
Oh, I've heard that story fifty times.

Dou.
Show the way, young woman, I'll follow -- you'll understand, Sir Leathermouth, that I'm obliged to you for your genuine kind reception.

[Exit Patty, P. S. 

Sir L.
Well, this is a cool insolent solicitor for a situation -- mustn't affront old Ledger, or I would turn him out neck and heels into Cornhill.

SCENE III.

-- Butler's room at Sir Leatherlip's -- a window supposed to be in the area -- practicable -- a door, leading out to the area in flat -- table -- three chairs.

Enter BUTLER , with newspaper, O. P.

But.
Politics are at a stand-still -- the papers on both sides the question are as dull as ditch water -- it's lucky my master Sir Leatherlip and I never enter into conversation on the state of public affairs, or I should not continue long his butler. 
Enter BLANCH with tea-things, P. S.

Thankye, Blanch, you are a good girl, and a capital housemaid -- such a contrast, your fine dingy arms drawing the muslin curtains -- but why your parents should ever have christened you Blanch? -- blanch'd almonds, you know are white.

Bla.
You always peek about de colour of my skin, Misser Butler; when white man first come to my country, me thought him poor pale unwholesum animal.

But.
Well, I believe it is the prejudices of edification, after all; so you shall stay and take your tea with me, provided you don't touch my bread and butter with your black fingers.

Bla.
Thanky you, Misser Butler -- me fetch more hot water?

[Exit P. S. 

But.
Don't scald yourself, else you'll turn red,

Patty. (Without.) 
This way, young man. 
Enter with DOUBIKINS, P. S.

This way.

Dou.
Oh, this is below, Nathaniel? I suppose you call it below, because it is down-stairs.

Pat.
Mr. Butler, master says this person is to remain here for an hour or so.

Dou.
An hour or so, young woman? I guess I've come for six months or so, or more tu, perhaps.

Pat.
Ah! that is if you're hired.

[Exit P. S. 

Dou.
What does she meam by hired? 
(To Butler.) 
How d'ye do? -- fine evening, I calculate.

But.
Oh, you are the man that brought the letter.

Dou.
I reckon the letter brought me -- this must be some relation of the family, I guess -- he's so uppish. If you're not agin answering, what may you be called in this house?

But.
Butler,

Dou.
Mr. Butler?

But.
When folks are civil, they call me Mr. Butler.

Dou.
And your grade in these premises?

But.
Grade? -- my occupation is to take care of Sir Leatherlip's store of wine.

Dou.
Oh, keep a wine store!

But.
Will you take a cup of tea while you stay?

Dou.
I've no objections. 
(Sits P. S. ) 
But I thinks I should like a small grain of something out of that same wine store.

(Butler pours out tea -- sitting O. P. ) 

But. (Apart.) 
Come, that's pretty well for a postillion. No, I can't do that without Sir Leatherlip's leave.

Dou. (Aside.) 
He only sells wine by commission, I guess -- darned shabby though!

(Takes the tea cup -- stirs it.) 

But.
Anything stirring in the country?

Dou.
I guess my teaspoon is! I can't say I like your catlap as we call it in our parts. 
(Apart.) 
Now I should like to discover Mr. Butler's opinion a little of the state of things.

But.
When I asked if there was anything stirring, I meant -- now, for instance, when the newspaper comes down full of London politics, what do the country people think of them; we of the lower house here, never get the newstill the upper house is done with them.

Dou. (Apart.) 
Lower house, upper house! This must be a member of the London Congress, by his talk.

But.
I read all the politics that come out -- Post, Chronicle, Times, and Herald -- and I am fully of opinion that the unalterable basis of civilization should ever coalesce with the inexpressible civil policy of a free and glorious constitution such as Old England possesses.

(Both rise.) 

Dou.
My own feelings to a hair! I'm very proud to have met with you, Mr. Butler.

But. (Apart.) 
This man is much too sensible for a postillion. Liberty, my friend, is a gift from heaven, and the glorious privilege of Britons!

Dou.
The glorious privilege of Americans, I guess! You've heard, mayhap, of the bright star of Columbia! which shed its genial influence all over the world, and shields us from tyranny and oppression? -- Do you want to buy a nigger?

But.
Who is this Uncle Ben you speak of?

Dou.
What, did you never hear of my Uncle Ben? I'll tell you. 
(Story, ad libitum. -- Enter BLANCH with tea-cup. She sits at table.) 
Oh, the dickens! I'm stunded! there's a she nigger! If I didn't think it was Aggy in petticuts! Mr. Butler, I don't pretend to know much about the decorum of the British Constitution, but there's one thing I don't approbate in your arrangement and economy at this present moment of consideration.

But.
What's that?

Dou.
Keeping company with your niggers.

But.
What does it matter whether the face is black, so that the heart is in the right place?

Dou. (Takes his book.) 
"English men of Congress drink tea freely with their female niggers." Depend upon it, that familiarity with a person of colour is very improper -- you'd be scouted at New York.

( AGAMEMNON walks up and down the rails outside. -- Sings, "Possum up a gum tree.") 

But.
What the devil's that?

Dou.
That nigger is tired of waiting in the street.

Blanch. (Opens area door.) 
It is only poor black man singing. Me gib him halfpenny.

But.
Blanch, I won't have you encourage every beggar in the street!

Dou. (Offended.) 
Beggar! no more a beggar than you are! He is my nigger! he's a slave, but not a beggar!

But.
Slave! -- nigger! -- I don't understand.

Dou.
I shall impute that to your ignorance then. I'll make it as clear as mud to you -- that's my Aggy!

But.
Your Aggy! more incomprehensible than before!

Enter AGAMEMNON and BLANCH , at door.

Aga.
Oh, Massa Jontam, don't be angry. Look here, pretty face -- me couldn't stand temptation; she handsomer than Miss Diana, my oder lover!

Dou.
There'll be a mighty jackdaw chattering, now with them two niggers come together! I say, Mr. Butler, you've got the she one already -- purchase him, and harkye, 
(Whispers.) 
if there should happen to be any little Agamemnons, they are all yours by the Virginian law -- oh, yes!

Re-enter PATTY, P. S.

Pat.
Master wants to speak to you again, Mr. Postillion that is to be.

Dou.
Mr. What, that is to be?

Pat.
Postillion.

Dou.
I don't know what new name I'm to have in this family.

Pat.
Come along, Mr. Postillion.

Dou.
Postillion again, eh? Oh, now I know -- 
(Writes.) 
"In England, all Americans are called Postillions."

[Exit with Patty, P. S. 

Bla.
Misser Butler, you know I faithful, let dis poor black man stay little, the oder gentplum know him.

But. (Aside.) 
My plate is locked up. Well, keep an eye on him Blanch, and if I don't return in five minutes take him into the kitchen -- but keep an eye on him.

[Exit, P. S. 

Aga.
Dere my lilly -- he tol you keep an eye on me -- why you take your pretty eye away?

Bla.
Cos -- cos -- cos -- 

(Holding down her head.) 

Aga.
Cos you blush all over you face -- me berry nice nigger -- my heart full of sediment -- only me a slave.

Bla.
Slave?

Aga.
Iss.

Bla.
My good man -- dere be no slave in dis country -- moment you put you foot on shore here in England you free;

Aga.
Free -- free! What is dat? me hear de name in America -- but me don't know what it is.

Bla.
You massa is not you massa no more -- if he tump you -- you tump again.

Aga.
Oh, nice country, England -- God sabe de king. Rule Britannia! give me kiss, you sweet moonlight sun-flower.

[Kisses her -- Exeunt, P. S. 

SCENE IV.

-- Parlour -- Chairs -- Table with Gasometer and Gas-light burning.

Enter LADY GROSSFEEDER, C. -- PATTY with a letter, P. S.

Lady G.
Patty, how is your master now?

Pat.
I think he is better, madam -- he has taken a bottle of hot egg'd wine, but he says, my lady, he wishes you would read this letter and see the person who brings it -- and a smart young man is waiting below for the answer.

Lady G. (Reads.) 
"To Sir L. Grossfeeder," 
(Opens -- reads.) 
"My dear Leatherlip." -- Why this is also from Mr. Ledger of Liverpool -- two epistles in one day. -- "I beg to recommend to your protection, the bearer, Mr. Jonathan W. Doubikins, an American youth -- he is the nephew of an old Transatlantic correspondent -- and any attention you may show him will be received as a kindness to your old friend, Robert Ledger." -- Instantly request the gentleman to come up, Patty.

Pat.
Yes, ma'am -- my lady, I mean.

[Exit, P. 

Lady G.
Stay -- here's a postscript 
(Reads.) 
"He is an odd person, rather brusque in his manners, and appears to be suffering from a defect in education." Well, well, we cannot all be learned -- this I suppose is the gentleman. 
(Enter NATTY LARKSPUR, P. S. , in his best clothes and a little bundle -- he bows awkwardly.) 
Your most obedient, sir -- pray walk in.

Nat.
Thank'ye ma'am, I -- 

Lady G.
Will you be so obliging as to take a chair, sir.

Nat.
Thank'ee ma'am; I'll make so bold as to stand.

Lady G.
How very much he is embarrassed -- I'll endeavour to set him at his ease by a little conversation. You are from -- 

Nat.
Liverpool, ma'am.

Lady G.
Liverpool, aye -- you landed there -- had you a pleasant trip over?

Nat.
Trip over -- no -- we came quite safe without any accident, ma'am.

Lady G.
I must beg you'll take a chair.

Nat (Apart.) 
Lauks! how civil to a poor body. 
(Sits awkwardly -- Gets up again and arranges his coat.) 
Must take care of my best clothes, that have laid so long at the pawnbroker's.

Lady G.
A little afraid of creasing your coat?

Nat.
Yes, ma'am -- coats is dear.

Lady G.
How long is it since you've seen your uncle?

Nat. (Apart.) 
My uncle -- ah, she knows I pledged these here things -- he's at Liverpool still, ma'am.

Lady G.
Your uncle at Liverpool? Is he not in the United States, sir?

Nat.
United States -- eh! -- Oh, yes, ma'am -- I believe he is a married man .

Lady G. (Apart.) 
How odd -- he does not give a direct answer -- a peculiarity of the Americans.

Enter SIR LEATHERLIP, O. P. , in night-gown, newspaper in his hand, much agitated -- He walks to and fro.)

Sir L
Oh, my lady. My lady -- pugh!

Lady G.
What is the matter, my dear, are you worse?

Sir L.
No, worse that that. Nantucky, the American stockbroker, has this moment sent me a New York paper, that I verily believe will destroy my appetite for a month to come.

Lady G.
What has happened?

Sir L.
Five thousand pounds -- poor Mary!

Lady G.
I'm all anxiety!

Sir L.
The house of Fleece, Fungus, Neverpay, and Co., have stopped!

Lady G.
Stopped?

Sir L.
Here's a paragraph says they have suspended payment -- that's the genteel New York phrase for bankruptcy -- they transacted business in the American funds -- just sent them out a power of attorney. Cash in their hands, and poor Mary's fortune is gone. 
(Sees Natty.) 
Who's that sheepish looking fellow?

Lady G.
Mr. Doubikins, my dear; perhaps as he is lately arrived from Liverpool, he can give us some intelligence.

Sir L.
You came from Liverpool last night. I beg your pardon, my dear sir -- give me your hand. 
(Natty draws back.) 
Come, come, I'm very glad to see you in spite of this unpleasant intelligence -- have you brought your luggage. 
(He shows his bundle.) 
Your night-cap, I suppose?

Nat.
Yes, sir, and my spurs.

Sir L.
Night-cap and spurs -- troubled with the nightmare, I suppose -- bed-ridden -- funny fellow. 
(Sighs.) 
Not at all -- five thousand. Oh Messrs. Fleece, Fungus, and Neverpay -- a pretty rascally firm.

Lady G. (To Natty.) 
Pray my dear Mr. Doubikins, have you heard anything of this matter?

Nat. (Apart.) 
Doubikins!

Sir L.
Now, my good fellow, tell me, do you know this news is true? Look here!

Nat. (Confused.) 
I never look at the newspapers, sir -- I -- 

Sir L.
But read this paragraph -- you've just arrived from the place, you can give me some information; read -- read!

Nat.
It was my misfortin never to learn to read, sir, thankye -- hope no 'fence.

Sir L.
Not at all -- oh, Doubikins, Doubikins! for shame!

Nat. (Apart.) 
Doubikins again -- some London nick name for stupid, I suppose.

Sir L.
Your uncle ought to have taught you better.

Nat.
Now he is at my uncle too! 
(Sobs.) 
I humbly wish you'd settle matters with me, and let me go to sleep in the hayloft, for I'm very tired.

Sir L.
Well, we didn't mean to hurt your feelings. 
(Apart.) 
Poor, ignorant creature -- hayloft indeed -- here's a pretty American specimen; I'm quite right in my favourite prejudice.

Enter DOUBIKINS, P. S. , with a cigar.

Dou. (Sings.) 

"Some say the devil's dead." 

Sir L.
This infernal chaise driver again.

Dou.
If it is all the same to you, Sir Leatherlip, I'm not fond of being packed with niggers below, so I'm come to chat with you a bit, I guess.

Nat. (Apart.) 
Oh, the tall Yankee with the mungo! that fatal beef! I shall lose the postillion's place.

(Retires up -- Lady Grossfeeder converses with him.) 

Dou.
What may your opinion be, Sir Leatherlip, respecting the commerce of this here old country and the new one?

Sir L.
Zounds fellow! get out of my way.

Dou.
Out of the way fellow? duds! he's sarsy.

Sir L.
I can't talk to you now about the place.

Dou.
Who wants to talk about the place. I want to sit still, I calculate. I've been up and down the staircase like a bucket in a well, and neither you nor that little gentleman below niver so much as axed me to taste a grain of your madeira.

Sir L.
My madeira! -- ha! ha! cool!

Dou.
Yes, I like it cool. I'm getting nation dry.

Sir L.
Get out of my house.

Dou.
No, seeing as how I had a letter of recommendation, it would be doing the thing that was wrong to go away without a proper cause assigned thereof.

Sir L.
I shall go mad. Will you quit the premises?

Dou.
By no manner of means!

(Sits down at table, and takes off hat.) 

Lady G. (To Natty.) 
Why do you tremble so, sir?

Nat. (Apart.) 
Oh, he's such a bad one. I saw him at the Greyhound at Liverpool, once, where a round of beef was stolen.

Dou.
I don't intend to budge till you've explained away this breach of genuine hospitality.

Sir L.
Not at all. What has genuine hospitality to do with hiring a post-boy?

Dou.
How should I know.

Sir L.
You come here to drive me through the streets of London, not to argue impertinently.

Dou.
I don't want to drive you through the streets of London, sit at home comfortably.

Sir L.
You shan't come into my house at all. I won't hire you into my service.

Dou.
Nobody axed you, no man ever hired or bribed me -- Uncle Ben did once, to fetch a squirrel out of a tree, but he never paid me the leetle trifle to this moment -- see, I've let my cigar go out -- here's a light here.

(Puts the cigar to the light near the gasometer.) 

Lady G.
Pray, for heaven's sake take care of your light there!

Dou.
I shan't hurt it, ma'am. Lord, what a fuss you make.

(Goes to light cigar. -- Gasometer explodes with a loud report. -- Doubikin's hat ascends into the flies.) 

Lady G.
My patent portable gasometer!

(Doubikins falls -- rises and looks foolish. Enter DELAPIERRE and MARY, O. P., BUTLER and PATTY, P. S. , all alarmed.) 

Mary.
Good heaven's, what is the matter?

Dou.
Has any accident occurred?

Dou.
Oh, yes; my hat is blown away, I calculate.

Sir L.
No great loss if it had been your head. Mr. Delapierre, I thought you were never to intrude.

Del.
I ventured once more to remonstrate.

Sir L.
Oh, sir, I think I've news here, which if true, will put an end to your matrimonial ardour; if that paragraph is correct, Mary's fortune is dissipated.

Del.
Then I joyfully take her portionless.

Sir L.
Come, come, I did not expect that from an American.

Dou.
American!

Del.
Yes -- an American, and I am proud of the country that gave me birth.

Dou.
And so am I tew , I guess -- I came from Varmount State, and all along shore there -- give me leave to ax where were you raised, what trade's your father? -- any news on change? What's Congress arter?

Sir L.
This fool of a postillion will drive me mad -- butler, go into the street -- tell two of the police officers to come here directly -- say here's a deranged postchaise driver, that I can't get out of my house.

[Exit Butler, P. S. 

Nat. (Sobs.) 
I'm sure I'm quite in my senses.

Sir L.
Who is alluding to you? You are the greatest idiot I ever met with, Mr. Doubikins!

Dou.
Thankye for the compliment. 
(Going towards Natty.) 
I'll ax this gentleman's opinion on the matter here, who has seen all and said nothing -- Dickens, I'm stunded! Oh, Greyhound -- knife -- beef -- murderer -- thieves -- cut a bit of fat out of Aggy!

Sir L.
We shall be all safe in a minute. Butler!

Enter BUTLER wiih two police officers, P. S.

Dou.
What does Mr. Butler want with those two officers?

Sir L. (Pointing to Dou.) 
Take this person before the Lord Mayor!

Dou.
Take me before the Lord Mayor -- oh, yes -- I had a letter of recommendation to Sir Leatherlip here, but I had no idea that I should be honoured by the countenance of the Lord Mayor. 
(Takes out his journal.) 
"September, 2nd. Invited to spend the day with the Lord Mayor, who sent two gentlemen in uniform to escort me" -- oh, yes, what will my Uncle Ben say to this, in America.

Sir L.
America? Your Uncle Ben?

Dou.
Oh, yes.

Sir L.
Why, what is your name?

Dou.
Jonathan W. Doubikins.

Lady G.
Then, in Heaven's name, young man, who are you?

Nat.
I am Natty.

Lady G.
Natty?

Nat.
I've come after the postillion's sitiation , if the saddle is vacant.

Sir L.
Why, how is this? -- where are the letters -- delivered incorrectly? I see -- I see! Have the goodness to retire, gentlemen. 
[Exeunt Officers -- To Dou.] 
I am apprehensive I have behaved very rudely to you.

Dou.
Oh, yes -- now perhaps you'll let me tell the story.

(A smash in the closet.) 

Lady G.
Ah! what's that?

Dou.
Something else exploded -- I hope it will blow my hat back again, for there isn't such another in London.

Pat
It's a cat, ma'am.

(Butler opens the door -- AGAMEMNON and BLANCH discovered.) 

Dou.
A couple of black cats! You villanous nigger, are you house breaking?

Aga.
No, massa, me only break de chaney!

Dou.
You rascally slave, I'll punish you!

Aga.
You punish! -- pooh! massa boss -- I free, dis is England -- I put my foot in it.

Sir L.
Mr. Delapierre, you have my consent to accept my ward's hand, whether the paragraph is correct or not; and I'll take care she does not come to you portionless.

Del.
Mary, sir, is my object!

Dou.
Paragraph! 
(Takes paper.) 
Ha! ha!

Sir L.
It is no laughing matter, sir! If the firm of Fleece and Company, have stopped payment -- 

Dou.
It is not true.

Omnes.
How!

Dou.
My Uncle Ben put that there in the paper, because, dy'e see, he wanted to buy a lot of stock at Baltimore; and he thought it would be likely to make it go cheap -- darned cute of Uncle Ben!

Del.
Shame on you, to boast of a fraudulent conduct, which in various instances has ruined thousands!

Dou.
Lawks! did your uncles never tell any white lies? I reckon.

Sir L.
Come, gentlemen, let our night pass in harmony; and permit me to welcome my American friends in London.

FINALE.

Omnes. 
If friends will not with fost'ring hands 
Protect us, we are undone. 
The stranger welcome to our land's, 
Poor Jonathan in London. 

Dou. 
Poor Jonathan will not be poor, 
If you'll let him write his tour. 

(Writes.)
"Thursday, second of September, 
An evening I shall well remember, 
And never can forget, because 
I was received with great applause." 

Omnes. 
If friends, &c., &c.

CURTAIN.
